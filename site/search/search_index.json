DAZED DAZED characters receive +1 on all attacks, checks, and saves. DISARMED DISARMED characters can't make weapon attacks except for improvised weapon attacks. IMMOBILIZED IMMOBILIZED characters can't voluntarily move, but can still be subjected to forced and involuntary movement. MARKED When attacking a MARKED character, the attacker can choose to consume the MARK. Doing this clears MARKED and grants +1 on that attack roll. A character can only have one MARK at a time. SILENCED SILENCED characters can't use or RELEASE spells. SLOWED SLOWED characters can only move with their standard movement; they can't RUSH or use any other forms of voluntary movement.SLOWED PCs can only take their turns in PHASE DELAY. SLOWED NPCs have their next Initiative become 8 (this lasts until they've taken that turn and the condition ends).

Unlike conditions, they can't be removed unless specific actions are taken or their requirements no longer apply.</p> Status Description BLOODIED Characters are BLOODIED when they have half of their HP maximum or less (their BLOODIED level). BREAKING Characters are BREAKING when they have Stress equal to or exceeding half their STRESS CAP (their BREAKING point). ENGAGED When a character becomes adjacent to an enemy, they both gain the ENGAGED status as long as they are adjacent to one another. ENGAGED characters make ranged attacks at +1. If a character becomes ENGAGED by another character of the same SIZE or larger, their movement ends and they lose any unused movement. Characters cease to be ENGAGED when they are no longer adjacent to an enemy. FLYING Characters with flight can either take off, gaining the FLYING status, or land on the ground, clearing the status, as a free action once per turn. They can also choose to start combat scenes FLYING.While a character is FLYING, the following effects apply: &gt; Non-thrown melee attacks from nonFLYING characters gain +2 against them. &gt; They can move normally over and are immune to the effects of terrain, obstructions, and terrain features, but cannot benefit from or interact with them either. When flying over objects, they are considered to have their SIZE increased by the SIZE of whatever they are flying over for the purposes of determining line of sight and cover, as if they were climbing. &gt; They cannot benefit from cover from terrain or objects. &gt; When attacking nonFLYING characters, they treat their target's cover from terrain and objects as one step lower (hard cover becomes soft cover, soft cover becomes no cover). &gt; They ignore ENGAGEMENT and don't cause ENGAGEMENT. &gt; They don't trigger Traps but can still be affected by them. &gt; They cease to be FLYING if they become PRONE. GRAPPLED GRAPPLED always involves at least two characters, both of whom receive the status. While GRAPPLED, the following effects apply: &gt; Both characters are ENGAGED. &gt; Neither character can take reactions. &gt; The larger character can move normally. &gt; The smaller character is IMMOBILIZED, but is dragged along by the larger character when they move, mirroring their movements and inheriting any special forms of movement like flight. &gt; If the initiator is the same SIZE as the target, they count as the larger one during the turn in which they initiate the GRAPPLE. &gt; Characters of the same SIZE can make a contested BULK check as a free action to see if they count as the larger one until this contest is repeated.GRAPPLED ends when one of the following occurs: &gt; The characters are no longer adjacent to each other. &gt; The initiator ends it as a free action. &gt; The GRAPPLE target succeeds on a contested BULK check as a minor action. HIDDEN While a character is HIDDEN, enemies can only target them with AOEs or while adjacent to them. They are still visible on the combat map to players and the GM. The following things end HIDDEN: &gt; The HIDDEN character uses a hostile effect (e.g., attacking or forcing a save) or uses INTERPOSE. &gt; The HIDDEN character ends any turn within an enemy's line of sight unless they are either INVISIBLE or benefiting from cover against that enemy. &gt; An enemy performs a successful SEARCH against them. INVISIBLE When making an attack against an INVISIBLE character, before any attack rolls are made, roll a d6. On a 1-3, the attack misses. INVISIBLE characters are still visible on the map to players and the GM. INVISIBLE lasts until the end of the scene unless stated otherwise. PRONE Attacks against PRONE targets gain +1 and PRONE characters always count as moving through difficult terrain.

Standing doesn't count as a form of movement."},{"location":"beacon/condtions_statuses_tags/#tags","title":"TAGS","text":"<p>Abilities often have tags associated with them, such as Aura 2, Piercing, or Polymorph. When an ability has a tag, the effects of that tag apply to the effects of that ability. Some abilities don't have tags, but do have effects that have a tag, or that create objects or characters with the tag, as indicated in their description.</p> <p>If an ability has a tag with a value of 'X', like Mana X, that means the amount can vary, but must be at least 1. Below is a list of tags and their effects.</p> Tag Description Accurate Attacks with this tag gain +1. Aetheric Attacks with this tag are made against A-DEF instead of DODGE. Arcing Abilities with this tag can be aimed over obstacles. They ignore line of sight as long as there is a vertical path to the target, although cover still applies. Armor Abilities with this tag represent suits of armor or similar defenses, many of which provide a bonus to ARMOR. A character can only have one ability with this tag equipped at a time. Aura X When activated, abilities with this tag affect indicated characters within X spaces of the user. A character can only have one Aura activated at a time and can change Auras 1/turn. Auto-Hit Attacks with this tag automatically hit without making an attack roll. Blast X Abilities with this tag have an AOE. It affects all targets within a radius of X spaces from the center space, including the center space. Cover and line of sight are calculated from the center space. Users can be affected by their own Blast. Burst X Affects all targets within a radius of X spaces from the edge of the spaces occupied by the target, including the target's spaces but excluding the target itself. Cover and line of sight are calculated from the edge of the spaces occupied by the target. If a Burst forms a zone, the zone moves with the target. Close Blast X Abilities with this tag have an AOE. It operates like a Blast, but:\u2019 at least 1 space must be adjacent to the user\u2019 the user can't be in the area\u2019 cover and line of sight are calculated from the user. Consumable X Abilities with this tag can only be used X times per quest. Consumable abilities represent potions, elixirs, and other items that can be replenished. Enchantment Abilities with this tag modify other abilities. Enchantments can typically only be applied to specific types of abilities and can only be applied to one ability at a time. Additionally, each ability can only have one Enchantment at a time. Traits and talents can't be enchanted. Focus X Abilities with this tag cost X Focus to use. Homing Abilities with this tag ignore line of sight and the effects of cover. As long as the target is within Range and it is possible to reach them (i.e., they aren't in a box), they can be targeted. Inaccurate Attacks with this tag receive +1. Indirect Attacks with this tag ignore any from cover. Innate Abilities with this tag can't be destroyed or enchanted. They can't be chosen for destruction as the result of a wound roll. Limited X Abilities with this tag can only be used X times per quest. Limited abilities provide powerful effects that can't be replenished during a quest once used. Line X Abilities with this tag have an AOE. It affects all targets in a straight line with a length of X spaces and a width of 1 space, drawn directly away from you in any direction. Mana X Abilities with this tag cost X MP to use. Piercing Damage with this tag ignores ARMOR. Polymorph Abilities with this tag modify the target's form. A character can only be under the effect of one ability with this tag at a time, and any subsequent polymorph effects are automatically cancelled while they are under the effects of a polymorph. Pull X Abilities with this tag inflict a type of forced movement. On a hit, the target is moved X spaces directly toward the origin. Push X Abilities with this tag inflict a type of forced movement. On a hit, the target is moved X spaces directly away from the origin. Range X Abilities with this tag can be used on targets within X spaces. Reach X Abilities with this tag can be used on targets within X spaces. This tag also determines the range of the OPPORTUNITY ATTACK reaction. Reliable X Abilities with this tag always deal at least X damage, even if they would miss or deal less than X damage. Reliable damage inherits the ability's damage type and tags; however, Reliable damage does not count as a hit and doesn't trigger any effects that require a hit. Reloading Abilities with this tag must be reloaded after each use before they can be used again. This can be done using REFRESH and other abilities. Slide X Abilities with this tag inflict a type of forced movement. On a hit, the target is moved X spaces in any direction. Slow Abilities with this tag can only be activated as part of FULL ATTACK. Stressful X Abilities with this tag inflict X Stress on the user. Summon Abilities with this tag create one or more temporary characters under the control of another character, each of which has the Summon tag.By default, each character can only have one Summon per ability with this tag in play at a time. If a Summon is defeated or dismissed, a new one can be made using that same ability. Summons can't create Summons. Summons have the following statistics unless otherwise indicated: &gt; SIZE 1/2 &gt; HP 5 &gt; DODGE/A-DEF 10 &gt; SPEED 0 &gt; SAVE TARGET = Summoner's SAVE TARGET &gt; BULK / AGILITY / MIND / MAGIC 0Summons can only be created in free spaces that they could normally enter (they can't be summoned into impassable terrain, for example).Summons are characters with a standard action, standard movement, and minor action per round; however, they can't perform any actions unless they have an ability that lets them do so and can't perform a movement unless they have SPEED. Their turn is their summoner's turn, and if they can take actions or move, they can do so at any point in their summoner's turn.Summons are defeated if they are reduced to 0 HP. They can also be dismissed by their summoner as a free action. Summons last until dismissed or defeated, or until the end of the scene. Thrown X Abilities with this tag can be used to make a thrown attack, a melee attack made against a target within X spaces. Thrown attacks are affected by cover. If throwing a weapon, it lands in a space adjacent to the target (thrower's choice), and must be picked up as a free action while adjacent to it before it can be used again. Trap Abilities with this tag place traps - objects that modify spaces - or are traps themselves. They must be placed in a free adjacent space. They become armed at the end of the turn in which they are placed. Moving into or adjacent to a space occupied by a trap triggers it, activating its effects, after which it is removed from play.Traps are permanently HIDDEN, but can be automatically detected with SEARCH. You can attempt to disarm a trap by making an AGILITY check as a minor action when moving into or adjacent to its space (before it is triggered). On a success, the trap is removed from play without being activated. On a failure, it activates as normal. Unbreakable Abilities with this tag cannot be destroyed and can't be selected for destruction if there are nonUnbreakable options left. If an Unbreakable result is selected from a wound or overstress roll, it becomes a DAZED result instead. Unique Characters can only equip one copy of each ability with this tag at a time."},{"location":"beacon/core_text/","title":"Core Rules","text":"<p>Beacon v1.16.0</p> <p>By: Tim Gonzalez, Pirate Gonzalez Games</p> <p>Editor:</p> <p>Melody Watson</p> <p>Layout:</p> <p>Minerva McJanda</p> <p>Cover Art:</p> <p>Rod Mendez</p> <p>Art: MJ Barros, Kyle Hebert, Cosmixian, Moid, Fran Bautista, Lim Li Wei (@Karagna_), Sita Duncan</p> <p>Character Sheet:</p> <p>Ellie Gales</p> <p>Legacy Art: Venus Jaw, Matthew Sargent, Alli Grimes</p> <p>Class and Role Icons:</p> <p>Lionel 'Electrum' C.</p> <p>Other Icons made by Lorc.

A scene is a series of events that focus on a person, place, or challenge. Each scene is either a narrative scene or a combat scene , falling under the rules of either combat play or narrative play .</p> <p>The GM determines when one scene ends and another begins, and whether the scenes are narrative or combat. But anyone can suggest or request a scene, and you are encouraged to do so.</p> <p>Combat scenes use the rules for combat play (p. 41). These scenes feature important fights and battles. Not every fight is worthy of a combat scene; only those that are important or tactically challenging move into combat play. A simple street fight or barroom brawl, for example, wouldn't start a combat scene. A fight on a crumbling bridge against a horde of demons, or a climactic showdown with an archnemesis would be worthy of a combat scene.</p> <p>Example: An angry necromancer has performed a ritual in a nearby cemetery, creating a continuous stream of undead soldiers that attack nearby towns. The beacons are asked to stop the necromancer and break the ritual. The GM sets up a combat scene with the beacons fighting in a misty cemetery against undead hordes and a necromancer riding an animated mausoleum!</p> <p>Narrative scenes, on the other hand, use the rules for narrative play (p. 22). Any scene that isn't a combat scene is considered a narrative scene. These scenes involve challenges that are resolved by rolling dice (called 'skill checks') or roleplaying. Small-scale fights can even happen during narrative play, but these fights are resolved just like any other challenge that happens during narrative play, using skill checks and roleplaying instead of the combat play rules.</p> <p>Example: The beacons need to get to a floating island and the only way to get there is with an airship. They don't have one, so they ask the GM for a scene with the Artificer's Guild. The GM sets up a scene in which the beacons meet the guildmaster directly. The beacons attempt to convince the guildmaster to let them borrow an airship, using a mix of roleplaying and skill checks to determine how successful their attempts are.</p>"},{"location":"beacon/core_text/#structure-of-play","title":"STRUCTURE OF PLAY","text":"<p>The gameplay of BEACON revolves around quests (p. 241). Quests are missions, tasks, or jobs provided to the beacons by the GM. Quests contain both combat and narrative scenes, connecting them to tell stories. The quests that your characters participate in form the body of your campaign , which is the overarching story of your characters.</p> <p>For example, your group's primary motivation might be to defeat a great evil. In order to gain the strength, allies, and resources to do so, they might need to</p> <p>undertake a number of quests, preparing themselves for the final showdown with their foe.</p> <p>The time between quests uses the rules for narrative play. During this time, the players collaboratively tell their beacons' stories and explore the world.</p> <p>When the players are ready to begin a new quest, they equip their beacons with abilities they've unlocked that they think will best suit the upcoming quest and the combat scenes within it.</p> <p>When the beacons return from a quest, they level up (p. 14) and become more powerful.

They do not achieve their goal and the GM describe what happens next. For example, the target could escape, the beacons arrive too late, or they don't get the necessary backing they need.</p> <p>Once every beacon has taken a turn, if they haven't yet succeeded or failed the challenge, they go again in any order.

They set the goal as  'capture the spy before they reach their submarine' with a simple difficulty.

He wants to immediately tackle and pin the spy, but since they need three more successes to win the skill challenge, he can't do that yet since it would end the skill challenge. Instead, he throws things at the spy to slow them down with his 'Perfected Body' background skill. He rolls a 20 - another success (2/4).</p> <p>Mallory is next. She decides to steal someone's horse to get ahead of the spy and cut off their escape route. She doesn't have a background skill to use. She rolls an 8, which is their first failure. Two more and they'll fail the challenge!</p> <p>Barbazar sees Mallory's struggles and wants to help. Since Mallory is a small halfling and Barbazar is incredibly strong, she offers to pick Mallory up and throw her ahead. Mallory loves this idea, so Barbazar rolls with her 'Bend Bars and Lift Gates' background skill and gets an 18, their third success (3/4).</p> <p>Everyone has taken a turn, so they go again. Because they're one success away from winning the challenge, everyone thinks it would be funny if Mallory were the one to catch the spy after being thrown like a missile. Mallory makes a roll with her 'Murderous Ball of Death' background skill and gets a 10, which is enough for their fourth and final success (4/4)!</p> <p>The GM describes how Mallory slams into the spy, sending them both tumbling into an alley below where the rest of the beacons are able to restrain them.</p> <p>4: narrative Play</p>"},{"location":"beacon/core_text/#adversity-challenges","title":"ADVERSITY CHALLENGES","text":"<p>Adversity challenges are special skill challenges used during quests.

The crystal is spawning monsters and weakening the ground, so the GM declares an adversity challenge. They set the goal as 'get to the bottom of the mine' and create three adversities: 'monster infestation' , 'destroyed path' , and 'unfamiliar terrain' . They decide this will be a simple challenge for four PCs, so they create two consequences: monster infestation will have the 'hurt' consequence and the destroyed path will have the 'delayed' consequence.</p> <p>The GM describes the scene, explaining how the mine is old and full of dead ends (unfamiliar terrain) and damaged minecart rails (destroyed path), which are the quickest method of navigation. Monsters fill every corner of the mine, spawned from the crystal buried deep within (monster infestation).</p> <p>Dhalia goes first. Because the mine is dark, she wants to illuminate it. The Scout approach is the best fit for her plan, so she makes a skill check with her 'Disciple of the Sun' background skill. She gets a 12, which is a hit. She doesn't have a good way to overcome any of the consequences so she holds onto her choice until the next combat scene.</p> <p>Barbazar goes next. She wants to use a minecart to get to the bottom of the mine quickly. Because the rails are damaged, her plan is to use her incredible strength to lift and jump the minecarts across the damaged sections. She picks the Endure approach and makes a skill check with her 'Bend Bars and Lift Gates' background skill. She rolls a 14, also a hit. One of her weapons was destroyed in an earlier combat, so she picks the 'Armorer' option to immediately repair it.</p> <p>Mallory wants to get rid of the monsters by hacking and slashing at them while riding past them in the minecart. She picks the Whittle approach and makes a skill check with her 'Murderous Ball of Death' background skill. She rolls a 23, which is a crit! She chooses the 'Surpass' option, overcoming the monster infestation consequence and holding her other choice until later.</p> <p>The GM decides that the actions of the beacons have gained the attention of a large monster in the mine. They describe a giant monster that starts chasing the PCs down the tunnels, adding a new adversity (but no new consequences).</p> <p>Dmitri wants to hold the giant monster off until they can reach the bottom of the mine. He uses the Endure approach and his 'Perfected Body' background skill to jump in the monster's mouth and keep it from biting anyone. He rolls a 17 and immediately chooses the 'Defensive' option.</p> <p>Now that every PC has acted, the GM describes how the PCs soar down to the bottom cave, the giant monster stuck in the entrance, too large to enter. The guardian of the crystal materializes and the beacons enter a combat scene. Everyone that didn't already choose a hit or crit effect from their approach can do so now. Because no one overcame the 'destroyed path' consequence, all beacons will suffer the effects of the 'hurt' consequence in this combat.</p> <p>4: narrative Play</p> <p>GettinG Started</p> <p>4: narrative Play</p> <p>BuildinG BeaconS</p> <p>runninG tHe Game aPPendiceS</p> <p>40</p> <p>This chapter contains the rules governing combat scenes.

Once the fighting is over, the scene ends.</p> <p>Rounds: Each combat scene is made up of a number of rounds , each of which is split up into eight distinct phases . At the end of the eighth phase, the round ends and another round begins.</p> <p>Turns: Each character takes one turn per round, taken during one of that round's phases. The action they want to take on their turn determines which phase they act in. On their turn, a character can perform their standard movement , one standard action , one minor action , and any number of free actions (within reason). Most NPCs only take one turn per round, but some NPCs might take multiple turns.</p> <p>The players and the GM's NPCs take turns on an alternating basis, with priority going to whichever side (PC or NPC) hasn't acted most recently.</p> <p>The PCs generally take the first turn in the first round of a combat scene. When multiple PCs want to take a turn at the same time, the PCs decide their order, and if an agreement can't be made, the GM will decide.</p> <p>Example: In the first round of combat, two PCs and one NPC want to act during PHASE SKIRMISH . No characters have taken a turn yet, so one of the PCs gets to take the first turn. Once they've taken their turn, the NPC can take their turn, followed by the final PC.</p> <p>Later that round, another PC wants to take their turn during PHASE FULL ATTACK . Normally an NPC could take their turn, but since there are no NPCs that can act during this phase, the PC takes their turn.</p> <p>Phases: Phases are the various stages of the round during which characters can act. The phase in which a character takes a turn is usually decided by the action they want to perform, as each action can only be performed in a specific phase. For example, characters can only DEFEND during PHASE BOLSTER and can only GRAPPLE in PHASE BRAWL .</p> <p>At the beginning of each phase, the side whose turn it is to act can nominate a character to take a turn (as long as they haven't already taken one this round). Once they've taken their turn, the other side may nominate a character, and so on.</p> <p>Once all characters that want to take a turn during a given phase have done so, the next phase begins.</p>"},{"location":"beacon/core_text/#the-battlefield","title":"THE BATTLEFIELD","text":"<p>Combat scenes in BEACON are played out on a battle map that uses either square or hex-shaped spaces (either is fine).

They ignore line of sight as long as there is a vertical path to the target, although cover still applies.</p> <p>Armor: Abilities with this tag represent suits of armor or similar defenses, many of which provide a bonus to ARMOR . A character can only have one ability with this tag equipped at a time.</p> <p>Aura X: When activated, abilities with this tag affect indicated characters within X spaces of the user.

They can also be dismissed by their summoner as a free action . Summons last until dismissed or defeated, or until the end of the scene.</p> <p>Trap: Abilities with this tag place traps - objects that modify spaces - or are traps themselves. They must be placed in a free adjacent space. They become armed at the end of the turn in which they are placed. Moving into or adjacent to a space occupied by a trap triggers it, activating its effects, after which it is removed from play.</p> <p>Traps are permanently HIDDEN , but can be automatically detected with SEARCH .  Y ou can attempt to disarm a trap by making an AGILITY check as a minor action when moving into or adjacent to its space (before it is triggered). On a success, the trap is removed from play without being activated.

For example, you might choose the elemental ancestry to represent a ghostly, spectral beacon.</p> <p>This chapter lists the available ancestries for players to choose. Each ancestry contains some questions you can answer to help flesh out the ancestry and your character, as well as an example of a Reflection and discussion of how that ancestry fits within it.

The purpose of this section is to make that job easier.</p>"},{"location":"beacon/core_text/#the-core-principles","title":"THE CORE PRINCIPLES","text":"<p>The core principles of BEACON apply to both players and the GM.</p> <ol> <li>The well-being and fun of the group, including both the players and the GM, is the top priority.</li> </ol> <p>The GM has the greatest ability to impact the fun of a game, but the players have a role as well. It's your job to make sure the story and game you're playing is fun for everyone. Anything else in the game is secondary to this rule. Sure, I've spent a lot of time trying to make the game fun to play, but if your group thinks that changing something would result in a better experience for everyone, then you should absolutely do that.</p> <ol> <li>Specific text takes precedent over general text.</li> </ol> <p>Some of the game rules in BEACON are general rules. For example, players can only perform certain actions in specific phases of combat. Weapons with the Slow tag, for instance, can only be used with the FULL ATTACK action. These are general rules.</p> <p>Many of the abilities available to players allow them to break these general rules, and that's intentional. To follow on from the above example, certain abilities allow players to attack with Slow weapons without using the FULL ATTACK action. That's a specific rule - it takes precedence over the general one.</p> <ol> <li>BEACON does not model reality or real-life physics, and is not meant to.</li> </ol> <p>This is not a simulation game. The Rule of Cool is the physics engine of this game, and the combat mechanics are designed like a board game or video game.</p> <ol> <li>Narrative play and combat play are distinct modes of play. The ability to do something in one mode does not automatically grant the ability to do it in the other.</li> </ol> <p>BEACON is designed to allow a wide variety of character types to exist without hampering player creativity; however, combat play features strict rules. It was designed to be played like a board game or video game, and only uses abilities specifically designed for combat play. Even though your character might be strong enough to throw an ox in narrative play, they can't just throw people around or tear down walls in combat play. They need an ability that allows them to do so, or a GM willing to let them make an ability check to attempt it.</p>"},{"location":"beacon/core_text/#5-in-combat-play-players-can-do-anything-their-abilities-allow-even-if-it-doesnt-make-narrative-sense","title":"5. In combat play, players can do anything their abilities allow, even if it doesn't make narrative sense.","text":"<p>It is the duty of the players and GM to explain how things happen in combat play, not to find reasons why they can't work. Basically, work backwards. If you're in a cave and a player calls down a lightning bolt from the sky, it happens. Now it's your job to figure out how or why the lightning bolt struck from the sky. Is the cave large enough to have clouds? Did it break through the roof? Was there a tiny hole?</p> <p>This intersects with several of the other principles listed here, such as Principle 3 and Principle 4.

T o do this, take the number of PCs that will be participating in the fight and multiply that number by 1.5.

SUPPLIES are minor items beacons can bring on quests that don't cost equipment slots or MEMORY to equip. They must be equipped at the beginning of each quest, at the same time as other equipment and techniques. Beacons can equip up to three SUPPLIES per quest (no duplicates), and all equipped SUPPLIES are destroyed at the end of the quest.</p> <p>Shops provide a way to thematically group SUPPLIES together. For example, the Alchemy Shop sells SUPPLIES that are narratively potions and elixirs, while the Tavern sells food and drink SUPPLIES . Beacons can buy or acquire SUPPLIES with the Go Shopping or Pursue a Profession downtime activities (p. 29, p. 31), but the GM can also give them out as rewards (p. 20).</p> <p>When beacons Go Shopping or otherwise have an opportunity to select SUPPLIES from a shop, not every option is always in stock. Instead, the GM either randomly or manually decides which SUPPLIES are currently available. It is recommended that no more than five different SUPPLIES are available in each shop at a time.</p> <p>Similarly, not every shop will be available during every downtime. For example, a city that hates magitech may not always have an Engineer available; however, the General Store should always be available.</p> GENERAL STORE GENERAL STORE GENERAL STORE ADVENTURINGSUPPLIESANDCOMMONGOODS .

Bosses have their own unique rules for combat.</p> <p>Battle Plan: Battle plans provide the framework for combat scenes, determining the win conditions for the PCs, the NPC budget, and any special rules.</p> <p>Class: Classes represent specialized approaches to combat. Classes unlock equipment and abilities that beacons can equip for quests. Each class has three ranks, with each rank unlocking additional equipment and abilities.</p> <p>Hub: A base of operations for beacons.</p> <p>Job: Jobs provide the starting values for a beacon's attributes and their equipment slots. A class's job is unlocked upon reaching rank 1 in that class.</p> <p>Level/Character Level: Each beacon has a character level , which represents their overall growth and strength. Whenever you finish a quest, whether you were successful or not, your beacon gains another character level. The maximum character level for beacons is 12.</p> <p>Loot: Loot includes a range of equipment and techniques that aren't tied to specific classes. It is usually presented to the players via loot crates . Loot is categorized by rarity. It can be Uncommon , Rare , or Legendary .</p> <p>Loot Crate: A loot crate is a set of three random pieces of loot from which the player can select one to keep.</p> <p>Non-Player Character (NPC): Characters controlled by the GM are called non-player characters , or NPCs.

Basically, if something does something in combat, it's an ability.</p> <p>Ability Check/Save: A roll made to overcome an obstacle or resist an effect. Effects that prompt ability checks or saves indicate which ability score BULK , AGILITY , MIND , or MAGIC is used for the roll. Background skills, GRIT , and titles don't apply. To succeed on an ability check , you need a result of 10+. To succeed on a save , your result must equal or exceed the SAVE TARGET of the initiator, or 10 if not otherwise specified.</p> <p>Ability Scores: The four ability scores BULK, AGILITY, MIND, MAGIC - affect a character's attributes and actions in combat play.</p> <p>Ally: A character friendly to you or on the same side. You don't count as your own ally.</p> <p>Area of Effect (AOE): Abilities and effects with an AOE affect multiple targets or spaces. Blast , Burst , Close Blast , and Line are types of AOEs.</p> <p>Attack: Attempts by characters to hit and harm something with weapons, magic, or other means. To hit your target, your result must equal or exceed their defense (either DODGE or A-DEF , depending on the type of attack). Attacks can be either melee attacks or ranged attacks , and can be further categorized as weapon, spell, support, or skill attacks.</p> <p>Attribute: Beacons have several attributes that are used in combat play, such as DODGE and SIZE .  These scores are determined by a character's level, job, ancestry, talents, ability scores, equipment, and techniques.</p> <p>Bonus Damage: Additional damage added onto an existing source of damage. Effects with more than one target only deal half their bonus damage to each target. Only successful attacks or abilities that deal damage can deal bonus damage.</p> <p>Character: PCs, Summons , and NPCs are all considered characters. As a general rule, characters are entities capable of taking some sort of actions, either personally or at the command of other characters.</p> <p>Climbing: A special form of movement that allows characters to move atop objects such as terrain. Climbing has a movement cost equal to the object's SIZE + 1 . Characters standing atop objects are considered to have their SIZE increased by the SIZE of whatever they are standing on for the purposes of determining line of sight and cover (p. 49).</p> <p>aPPendiceS</p> <p>Concentration Save: While channeling, if you take any damage (after ARMOR ) or Stress not caused by yourself, you must pass a BULK save against the initiator's SAVE TARGET . On a failure, you stop channeling and the action is lost.</p> <p>Cover: Objects on the battlefield can provide cover. Cover imposes on attacks and can block line of sight, depending on whether it is hard cover or soft cover . Soft cover grants +1 to attacks, but doesn't block line of sight. Hard cover grants +2 to attacks and can block line of sight.</p> <p>Critical Hit: On a result of 20+, an attack roll is a crit . Roll all damage dice twice and take the highest result.</p> <p>Damage: Harm done to another character. Damage is subtracted from HP , and comes in different types (Physical, Force, Astral, Lunar, Discord).</p> <p>Dangerous Terrain: Terrain that can cause damage. 1/round when you enter dangerous terrain or end your turn in it, you must make an ability check of the GM's choice. Failure: Y ou take 5 damage of any type or Stress based on the type of terrain.</p> <p>Defeat: When a beacon is defeated, all effects on them and that originated from them are removed, including Summons . Damage, conditions, statuses, and created objects and terrain remain, including Traps .</p> <p>Difficult Terrain: Terrain that slows movement. It has +1 movement cost.</p> <p>Discord X: Discord is a special effect that applies ongoing damage. A character or object that takes Discord immediately takes Piercing discord damage equal to the amount of Discord gained. The Discord they took is then added to any Discord they already have. At the end of each turn while they have Discord, the character or object makes a MAGIC check. On a successful save, all Discord is cleared from them. On a failure, they take Piercing discord damage equal to their current Discord. For more information on Discord, see p. 58.</p> <p>Enemy: A character that is hostile to you or on the other side.</p> <p>Environmental Factors: Effects that alter combat scenes, individual spaces, or even objects. Some apply to the entire combat scene, while others affect characters in smaller areas.</p> <p>Equipment: Weapons and support items are equipment.</p> <p>Flight: Characters with flight can activate or deactivate the FLYING status 1/turn as a free action.</p> <p>Forced Movement: Any involuntary movement that pushes , pulls , or slides a character. Forced movements do not provoke reactions and ignore ENGAGEMENT .  Y ou can't be forcibly moved into a space you can't enter.</p> <p>Free Action: Free actions can only be taken during your turn, but you can perform any number of free actions during that turn.</p> <p>Grit: An attribute representing the combat experience that beacons gain when they increase their character level. Starting at character level 2 and then at every second level after that (i.e., levels 4, 6, 8, etc.), beacons gain +1 GRIT . GRIT is a passive bonus that applies to several other attributes.</p> <p>Immunity: When a character is immune to something, they are unaffected by that type of effect.</p> <p>Initiative: NPCs take their turns in a different way than PCs. Instead of acting based on the phase of the standard action they want to perform, each NPC has an INITIATIVE , which ranges from 1-8. This specifies the phase in which they take their turn. During that phase, the NPC can take any action, not only those options available to PCs during that phase.</p> <p>Limit Break: Every job has a limit break, which is a power, scene-changing ability unique to that job. Beacons can only perform one limit break per quest.</p> <p>Line of Sight: All abilities require a clear path to their target, known as line of sight.</p> <p>Linked Weapons: Two weapons can be linked together to form a linked pair .  When you attack with a linked weapon, you can also attack with the weapon it's linked to as a part of the same action. This is called a linked attack, and each linked pair can only make 1 linked attack per turn (p. 16).</p> <p>Minor Action: Y ou can perform one minor action during your turn. Minor actions can be used during any phase.</p> <p>Movement/Standard Movement: You can use your standard movement to move a number of spaces equal to your SPEED .</p> <p>Object : Anything that isn't a character (or part of one). The terrain, parts of the environment, and deployed items (like Traps ) are all objects.</p> <p>Obstruction: If a character or object is the same SIZE as you or larger, you can't move through their spaces. Allied characters and enemy characters smaller than you don't count as obstructions and you can move through their spaces, but you can't end a movement sharing spaces with another character.</p> <p>Phase: The various stages of the round during which characters can act. The phase in which a character takes a turn is usually decided by the action they want to perform, as each action can only be performed in a specific phase.</p> <p>Range/Reach: The maximum number of spaces within which a given ability can be used. Range and Reach work in the same way, but some effects trigger based on one or the other, not both.</p> <p>Reaction: Special actions performed in response to specific triggers, even on other character's turns. You can perform one reaction per turn, but there is no limit on how many times a specific reaction can be used unless one is specified.</p> <p>Reroll Table: When making an attack, ability check, or save in combat , you can reroll the dice by using the Reroll Table . To use the table, you choose one of the listed options and reroll all dice for one roll (including or ). Each option from the table can only be chosen once per round (p. 52).</p> <p>Resistance: Reduces damage by half.</p> <p>Round: Each combat scene is made up of a number of rounds , each of which is split up into eight distinct phases . At the end of the eighth phase, the round ends and another round begins.</p> <p>Shift: A special movement that doesn't provoke reactions and ignores ENGAGEMENT . You can't shift if you are SLOWED or IMMOBILIZED .</p> <p>Scene: An entire combat, from beginning to end. Once the fighting is over, the scene ends.</p> <p>Squeezing: A special form of movement that allows characters to fit into spaces one SIZE smaller than them, but increases the cost of all movements by +1 while doing so (p. 55).</p> <p>Standard Action: Characters can take one standard action per turn. Beacons can only use standard actions from the current phase.</p> <p>Stress: A special type of harm that doesn't count as damage and doesn't affect the recipient's HP . Stress accumulates up to a character's STRESS CAP .</p> <p>Surging: Beacons can surge 1/round to take a second turn at the cost of taking Stress (p. 42).</p> <p>Talent: Sets of abilities that don't need to be equipped. Once your beacon has learned a talent, they will always have access to any abilities unlocked by their ranks in that talent. Each talent has three ranks.</p> <p>Techniques: Skills and spells are techniques.</p> <p>Teleport: A special form of movement that allows for instant movement between two spaces. Teleportation doesn't require line of sight, doesn't provoke reactions , and ignores ENGAGEMENT .  T eleportation always counts as moving 1 space. If a character teleports into a space they can't occupy, the teleport fails and the action is lost.</p> <p>Terrain: A specific subset of object that includes the environmental elements in a combat scene - trees, walls, rocks, and similar.</p> <p>Terrain Features: Terrain features modify spaces and terrain on the battlefield. While they generally affect single spaces, multiple terrain features can be placed next to each other to create a continuous feature.</p> <p>Trait: Abilities that reinforce a beacon's identity and playstyle. Traits come from a beacon's ancestry and equipped job.</p> <p>Turns: Each character takes one turn per round, taken during one of that round's phases. The action they want to take on their turn determines which phase they act in. On their turn, a character can perform their standard movement , one standard action , one minor action , and any number of free actions (within reason). Most NPCs only take one turn per round, but some NPCs might take multiple turns.</p> <p>Wound/Overstress: Characters can receive Wounds or become Overstressed . As they accumulate Wounds and Overstresses, their combat performance weakens until they are no longer able to fight.</p> <p>Zone: A lingering effect from an AOE, which remains in play for a set time or until the end of the scene.</p>"},{"location":"beacon/core_text/#tags_1","title":"TAGS","text":"<p>Accurate: Attacks with this tag gain +1 .</p> <p>Aetheric: Attacks with this tag are made against A-Def instead of Dodge.</p> <p>Arcing: Abilities with this tag can be aimed over obstacles.

Enchantments can only be applied to a new ability while preparing for a quest or during a Long Rest.</p> <p>If an Enchantment is destroyed, the ability it is enchanting is not destroyed and vice versa. Traits and talents can't be enchanted.</p> <p>Focus X: Abilities with this tag cost X FOCUS to use.</p> <p>Homing: Abilities with this tag ignore line of sight and the effects of cover. As long as the target is within Range and it is possible to reach them (i.e., they aren't in a box), they can be targeted.</p> <p>Inaccurate: Attacks with this tag receive +1 .</p> <p>Indirect: Attacks with this tag ignore any from cover.</p> <p>Innate: Abilities with this tag can't be destroyed or enchanted.

On a hit, the target is moved X spaces directly away from the origin.</p> <p>Range X: Abilities with this tag can be used on targets within X spaces.</p> <p>Reach X: Abilities with this tag can be used on targets within X spaces. This tag also determines the range of the OPPORTUNITY ATTACK reaction.</p> <p>Recharge X: Whenever an NPC uses a Recharge ability, it can't be used again until that ability recharges. At the start of each of the NPC's turns after using a Recharge ability, the NPC rolls a d6 recharge die . If the result equals or exceeds the Recharge value (X) of any Recharge abilities they have, those abilities recharge. NPCs only make one recharge roll each turn, but that roll can recharge multiple abilities at once.</p> <p>Reliable X: Abilities with this tag always deal at least X damage , even if they would miss or deal less than X damage . Reliable damage inherits the ability's damage type and tags; however, Reliable damage does not count as a hit and doesn't trigger any effects that require a hit.</p> <p>Reloading: Abilities with this tag must be reloaded after each use before they can be used again. This can be done using REFRESH and other abilities.</p> <p>Slide X: Abilities with this tag inflict a type of forced movement.

Their turn is their summoner's turn, and if they can take actions or move, they can do so at any point in their summoner's turn.</p> <p>Summons are defeated if they are reduced to 0 HP. They can also be dismissed by their summoner as a free action . Summons last until dismissed or defeated, or until the end of the scene.</p> <p>By default, each character can only have one Summon per ability with this tag in play at a time. If a Summon is defeated or dismissed, a new one can be made using that same ability. Summons can't create Summons.</p> <p>Thrown X: Abilities with this tag can be used to make a thrown attack , a melee attack made against a target within X spaces. Thrown attacks are affected by cover. If throwing a weapon, it lands in a space adjacent to the target (thrower's choice), and must be picked up as a free action while adjacent to it before it can be used again.</p> <p>Trap: Abilities with this tag place traps - objects that modify spaces - or are traps themselves. They must be placed in a free adjacent space. They become armed at the end of the turn in which they are placed. Moving into or adjacent to a space occupied by a trap triggers it, activating its effects, after which it is removed from play.</p> <p>Traps are permanently HIDDEN , but can be automatically detected with SEARCH .  Y ou can attempt to disarm a trap by making an AGILITY check as a minor action when moving into or adjacent to its space (before it is triggered). On a success, the trap is removed from play without being activated. On a failure, it activates as normal.</p> <p>Unbreakable: Abilities with this tag cannot be destroyed and can't be selected for destruction if there are nonUnbreakable options left. If an Unbreakable result is selected from a wound or overstress roll, it becomes a DAZED result instead.</p> <p>Unique: Characters can only equip one copy of each ability with this tag at a time.</p>

One that specifically requires the DEFEND action - a basic PHASE 1 BOLSTER action - would say '1 DEFEND'.</p> <p>If an ability lists an action (e.g., VOLLEY ), you use that action to activate the ability instead of the normal effects of the action. For example, the HEROIC LEAP skill requires the RUSH action to activate. A beacon can use this skill when they take the RUSH action, but can't also move up to their SPEED per the normal RUSH action effects (p. 44). If an ability requires a minor action or free action , it can be performed during any phase as long as it is your turn.</p> <p>If an ability lists a phase but not an action (e.g., PHASE SKIRMISH ) activating it requires you to perform it as your standard action during the indicated phase, but it doesn't count as one of that phase's basic actions ( VOLLEY, DEFEND, etc.) for the purposes of triggered effects.

They always take their turn in PHASE BOLSTER , and they could use their standard action in that phase for any action, not just DEFEND or RECOVER .</p> <p>Example: Dhalia wants to attack with her bow, which is a VOLLEY weapon. This requires her to use the VOLLEY action during PHASE SKIRMISH , because that phase allows the use of VOLLEY . If she has any abilities that trigger off of the use of a VOLLEY action, like the PINCER STRIKE loot skill, they also go into effect.</p> <p>Later, Dhalia wants to use her MOCK skill from the Skald class.

Our Lifebinding Spirits, the steadfast companions of our faith, are bound beside us, comforting and aiding us in the stewardship we've been given.</p> <p>As a Shepherd, you:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Embrace the Balance. Embody the forces of Life and Death, wielding spells from your chosen domains. As you walk the path of balance, ponder which way the scales shall tip: towards healing or harm?</p> </li> <li> <p>Lead a Faithful Companion. Summon a Lifebinding spirit to your side, providing invaluable support in battle. Whether bolstering allies with healing or smiting foes with righteous fury, your spirit companion stands ready to aid in the struggle. </p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"nimble/classes/shepherd/#core-stats","title":"Core Stats","text":"Key Stats WIL, STR Secondary Stats INT, DEX Hit Die 1d10 Starting HP 17 Armor Mail Armor, Shields Weapons STR Weapons, Wands Save Advantage WIL Save Disadvantage DEX"},{"location":"nimble/classes/shepherd/#leveling-table","title":"Leveling Table","text":""},{"location":"nimble/classes/shepherd/#level-1","title":"Level 1","text":"<p>Keeper of Life and Death</p> <p>You know Radiant and Necrotic cantrips.</p> <p>Searing Light (Action)</p> <p>Heal or Inflict grievous injuries:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Heal WIL d8 HP to a Dying creature within Reach 6.

Each school has its own basic spells called cantrips and 9 tiers of progressively more powerful spells that can be unlocked as heroes level up. Heroes can cast any spell from the schools that they know within the tiers they have unlocked.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Mana </p> <ul> <li>Powerful tiered spells require mana-a portion of the spellcaster's life force-to fuel them. A spell's mana cost is equal to its tier. See the Heroes book for more info on how different classes gain mana.

Add 1 die of disadvantage to gain +2 Range (max +6). Spells with 'Reach' can't do this, but they are cast as normal even when in melee.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> School Description Fire Spells Deal high, consistent damage at medium range. Some fire spells can inflict the Smoldering condition and gain additional destructive effects against Smoldering enemies. Ice Spells Deal medium damage at long range, with a focus on controlling the battlefield and protecting the spellcaster. Some ice spells have additional effects against Hampered targets. Lightning Spells Deal high damage at long range with a focus on teleporting around the battlefield and taking advantage of creatures equipped with metal. However, some lightning spells may fail to find ground and damage the spellcaster instead. Necrotic Spells Summon horrible minions or manipulate and trap targets. Some risky necrotic spells prey upon damaged creatures, sapping their very life force; but frequently fail to distinguish between friend and foe. Radiant Spells Can obliterate the unholy, the fearful, and those who would dare harm you or your allies. Equally effective at a distance or in melee. Other spells can protect, mend wounds, and even restore creatures back to life! Wind Spells Aid in moving friend and foe alike around the battlefield. They can also slice and cut through entire groups of foes and viciously deal extra damage on critical hits. <p>Secret Spells. Some spells have been hidden or lost through the ages. Whether they are too dangerous to be common knowledge or for other reasons, adventurers can sometimes stumble upon new spells (or wrench them out of the undead hands of a defeated Lich).</p>"},{"location":"nimble/spells/wind_spells/","title":"Wind Spells","text":""},{"location":"nimble/spells/wind_spells/#razor-wind","title":"Razor Wind","text":"<p>Razor Wind</p> <p>Tier: Cantrip | 1 Action</p> <p>Range: <code>12</code> | Target: <code>Single Target</code>  | Damage: <code>1d4 slashing (Vicious)</code></p> <p>Vicious: roll 1 additional die whenever you roll crit damage.
