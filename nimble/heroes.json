Those of barbaric nature are said to eat only the dust of war and drink naught but the blood of those felled by their own hand.\nDeath is no stranger, for it is said that even death fears to take a Berserker before his battle Rage is satiated. Once a Berserker has begun to fight, he only grows stronger, fueled by battle-lust and an unending Rage. The deadliest among them is not the wellrested, but those who are pushed to the brink through combat. It matters not what a Berserker takes up, be it axe or sword; flesh will be hewn from bone and heads from shoulders. Many have caved under the Berserker's primal might-sword and spell are but straw in the wake of unbridled Rage. As a Berserker, you can:\n- Become a raging, damage-dealing machine. Greet death as an old friend and keep on fighting!\n- Increase your damage to unbelievable levels. The longer a fight goes on, the more your Rage intensifies, allowing you to deal out incredible amounts of brutality.\n- Use your Savage Arsenal. Choose abilities to crush your foes and laugh in the face of death!",

We Hunters called groves and fields home, just as the elk and boar still do. We have trained our minds and hearts as much as we have trained with bows.\nFor, there is great danger in becoming a Hunter: the intoxicating Thrill of the Hunt that washes over your body when stalking prey. Be warned—do not allow it to settle into your heart. For no true Hunter takes without recognizing what they have first been given: a soul, a meal… warmth, all at a cost—a life. And that should not be taken lightly. Wherever you roam, be it city or glade, mountain or valley, as long as The Wild is tenderly tucked into the depths of your heart, you will always be a Hunter. May your arrows strike true and your bowstrings never break.\nHunters are:\n- Relentless Trackers. As an expert survivalist, you mark your prey, becoming a shadow in pursuit, relentless and precise.\n- Masters of the Wild. Harness the Thrill of the Hunt to outwit your targets—set decoys, spring traps, and strike with lethal efficiency.\n- Deadly from Afar or Up Close. Whether you're raining arrows from a distance or closing in for a personal takedown, your prey won't escape your reach.",

Yes, this is the chosen path of those who would wield authority over the elements.\nComprehending the tapestry of mana is no trivial endeavor—it will yield its arcane secrets only to the earnest seeker of knowledge. Yet, once the adept learns to discern the subtleties of its intricate patterns as it unfurls and meanders into the ethereal expanse—it is in that moment the apprentice truly ascends to the mantle of mage.\nMages are:\n- Spellshaper. Customize the spells you cast: stretch time, gain extra-dimensional vision, or echo cast multiple spells!\n- Elemental Mastery. Harness the power of the elements, whether raining down fire from the heavens, freezing enemies in their tracks, or striking with thunderous bolts of lightning.\n- Chaos or Control. Will you snatch control of the frayed tapestry of mana or lean into the forces of chaos? What awaits you… Diamond Skin? Elemental Entanglement? Liquefy Legs?",

Just scheme up a way to take what you need from someone who won't miss it—ancient horrors don't guard their power nearly as well as you'd think! And if there's power just laying around, it'd be dumb of me to not use it, really.\nSo what if I wear black and have to occasionally sacrifice an animal here and there while chanting? Does that automatically mean I'm evil? Pfft, hardly! Not every ANCIENT HORROR is the same; that's like saying crow black and spider black are the same. Okay, bad examples, but the point stands. If you're tired of swinging swords around and getting sweaty like a peasant, just summon a horde of shadow minions to do your bidding. They're always eager to serve!\nAs a Shadowmancer:\n- Unspeakable Power Awaits. Use your cunning to forge pacts with ancient, unfathomable entities, drawing upon their incomprehensible power to crush foes and bend the shadows to your will.\n- Master Shadow Minions. Summon legions of shadowy minions to overwhelm your adversaries and bolster your magical abilities. Let them swarm your foes, serving as both sword and fodder in your quest for dominance.",

Embody the forces of Life and Death, wielding spells from your chosen domains. As you walk the path of balance, ponder which way the scales shall tip: towards healing or harm?\n- Lead a Faithful Companion.

Each Songweaver holds a spark granted to them by a muse at birth; a spark which fuels their creative energy and flows forth in the form of a sharp wit, relentless humor, or moving art.\nThe power of a Songweaver's spark is also evident in their powerful sway over others. Songweavers can bolster and infuse courage in their allies, or… make their enemies' brains leak out through their ears. The Songweaver can bring a whole new meaning to verbal abuse! They can even redirect the (often justified) attacks of others, in order to protect their own moneymakers.\nAs a Songweaver, you can:\n- Charm the hapless people you meet and inspire your allies to reach fantastic new heights of heroism!\n- Use your Lyrical Weaponry and powerful charisma to dominate enemies and call special friends to aid you in your journeys and battles. You can even redirect attacks away from yourself and make enemies attack their own allies!\n- Control the Battlefield with a chord of chaos, a rad heroic ballad, or a debilitating rhapsody; make your allies and enemies alike dance to your tune!",
