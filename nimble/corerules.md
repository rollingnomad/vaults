## Start Here

Nimble is a fast-paced, heroic fantasy TTRPG where bold choices and epic stories take center stage.

At least one player should familiarize themselves with the base rules in this book (no need for everyone to read through unless they really want to). The adventure included in the GM's Guide is designed to introduce the rules as you play.

If you're new to TTRPGs, use one of the premade heroes (included in your digital downloads or at nimbleRPG.com/start). Level 1 for all of the classes is designed to be easy to pick up, giving a small flavor of the class and introducing the rules gradually without being overwhelming. Complexity and tactical depth is layered on as you level up and progress through an adventure.

If you're experienced with RPGs , feel free to create your own hero from scratch (see 'Char- acter Creation' on pg. 19). When building your hero, perhaps what will have the largest impact on how you interact with the world is your hero's class. Start there. Then you can flesh out other important aspects of your character's ancestry, background, and what languages you know, as well as your stats and any equipment you have. You can do these steps in any order, filling out your character sheet as you go. Now, go start playing!

## How to Be a Good Player

Be heroic. Create a hero eager to dive into the adventure with the party. Reluctant, anti-social loners can drag down everyone's fun. Your games will shine when you lean into the shared adventure.

Pay attention. Ask questions. Take notes. The more questions you ask, the more information you'll have to work with, and you'll be able to make more interesting decisions.

Be creative! Frequently, the answer to a problem isn't found on your character sheet. A hammer (or anything else) can be used in lots of ways!

Embrace failure. You shouldn't try to fail, but some of the best moments in a game can come from a failed roll or bad decision. Go with it!

Respect everyone else's time. Swift, suboptimal decisions are better than slow, optimal ones. They will tend to be more fun anyway! If you can't decide what to do on your turn, attack and pass. Think when everyone else isn't waiting on you. Also, arrive on time.

Share the spotlight. If you've been rolling or talking more than everyone else, call on your partymates to help you; shine the spotlight on them.

Sneaky characters shouldn't spend a bunch of time sneaking around a dungeon without the rest of the party. A charismatic hero might be taking the lead in a negotiation (that's fine!), but he may want to call on his Berserker pal for a bit of extra leverage. 'Ragnar, would you like to have a word with this stubborn gentleman while the rest of us step outside?'

Treat the world realistically. If you insult (or kill) other characters you come across, expect consequences! If you negotiate and haggle with every merchant, your reputation as penny pinchers will likely become widespread. If you do something foolish in front of a king, expect to be jailed (or worse). If you heal an ally, deal lots of damage, or always use the same tactics, expect the bad guys to catch on and adapt.

Describe your actions, not mechanics. The Game Master (GM, the player running the game) will tell you if you need to roll any dice. If your idea is good enough, you may not need to!

No: 'Can I make an Examination check?'

Yes: 'I want to search the books and paintings on the walls, looking for a secret door.'

No: 'I make an attack roll.'

Yes: 'I smack that goblin with my sword!'

No: 'Save your reaction, I'm only at 2 Wounds, I can take three more.'

Yes: 'Leave me be, I can take the hit!'

Note. If  these  examples  don't  mean anything to you, that's okay, you'll get the hang of it after playing once or twice.

Be gracious to the GM. They put a lot of effort into running the game; avoid arguing over rulings. Give them a break sometimes and offer to run a session for them! Bring snacks.

## CORE RULES

ARTIST: EDWARD YORKE

## Stats

Heroes have 4 stats that impact their effectiveness in various tasks: 2 Key Stats crucial to their class and 2 Secondary Stats. The maximum a hero's stat can typically go is +5 .

KEY. When an ability or spell references 'KEY,' use one of your Key Stats. If a stat is listed before a die roll, roll a number of dice equal to the stat. For example, 'WIL x d8' means that if your WIL is 2, you roll 2d8 (two eight-sided dice).

|**Strength** (STR)| Your raw physical power and resilience,  endurance,  and  resistance  to  harm. Affects STR weapon damage, resistance to Wounds, HP recovery, Concentration, STR saves, carrying capacity, Grappling, and the Might skill.|
|:---:|---|
| **Intelligence** (INT) |Your Intelligence reflects knowledge and reasoning across fields like the arcane, tactics, or street smarts. Affects languages, spellcasting, use of wands, spell scrolls, INT saves, as well as the Arcana, Examination, and Lore skills. |
| **Dexterity** (DEX) | Your agility, reflexes, and precision with blades or bows. Affects DEX weapon damage, Initiative, DEX saves, Grappling, and can contribute to Armor, as well as the Stealth and Finesse skills. |
| **Will** (WIL) | Your force of personality, courage, and wisdom. Will shapes your interactions with both nature and society. Affects spellcasting and WIL saves, as well as the Insight, Influence, Naturecraft, and Perception skills.|

## Skills

Skills gauge how well your hero interacts with the world. Whenever you tell the GM what you are doing, they may ask you to use one of your skills.

| Arcana (INT) | Your understanding of magical phenomena, spells, and enchantments. With Arcana, you can identify magical effects, decipher arcane symbols, and discern the properties of magical items. It also grants insights into the abilities and weaknesses of magical beings like Aberrations, Elementals, and Oozes.|
|:---:|   |
| Examination (INT) | Your aptitude for thorough analysis and deduction. Use Examination to diagnose injuries, determine causes of death, uncover clues, and unravel the workings of traps or mechanical devices. It also grants insights into the abilities and weaknesses of Constructs.|
| Finesse (DEX) | Your ability to use your hands and feet in careful ways. Use Finesse for activities such as picking locks, disarming traps, piloting vehicles, tinkering, card tricks, stealing or planting items, climbing a mossy wall, or any other task that requires precise, careful movement.|
| Influence (WIL) | Your persuasiveness, charm, and ability to influence others through charisma or cunning. Use Influence to convince or deceive people, negotiate deals, build trust, win allies to your cause, or put on a captivating performance.|
| Insight  (WIL) | Your  ability  to  understand people and situations beyond the obvious. Use Insight to sense motives, detect lies, read hidden emotions, make sense of clues, and when faced with uncertainty-you can think ahead or just 'get' what is happening. Insight can be used to retroactively change situations: Player: 'Oh no! I forgot to buy rope back in town!' GM: 'Give me an Insight check; maybe your hero would have thought about it.'|
| Might (STR) | Your ability to apply strength effectively. Use Might for lifting heavy objects, breaking through obstacles, climbing, swimming, jumping, or performing feats of strength.|
| Lore (INT) | Your understanding of the history of civilization, kingdoms, and religions. Use Lore to recall historical events and grasp the significance of cultural practices. It extends to knowledge of the abilities and behavior of Celestials, Dragons, Fey, Fiends, Giants, Humanoids, and Undead.|
| Naturecraft (WIL) | Your expertise in wilder ness survival, navigation, tracking, and the han dling of animals. Use Naturecraft to thrive in the wild, identify Ŵora, fauna, and tracN creatures with precision. It encompasses knowledge of Beasts, Monstrosities, and Plants, providing insights into their behavior, habitats, and characteristics.|
| Perception (WIL) | Your overall ability to notice subtle details in your surroundings. Use Perception to spot hidden objects, detect secret passages, sense subtle environmental changes, and sense when you're being followed or observed. It encom passes your ability to pick up on non-obvious cues, and hidden threats.|
| Stealth  (DEX) | Your  proficiency  in  staying unseen and moving quietly. Use Stealth to hide, slip past guards, evade detection, and move with out drawing attention.|

## Skill Checks & Saves

When you want to affect the world (convince an NPC, spot a trap, pick a lock, etc.), the GM may call for a skill check. Roll 1d20 and add your skill (the max bonus a skill can ever have is +12). If the total meets or exceeds the Difficulty Challenge (DC), you succeed; otherwise, you fail. A roll of 1 always fails regardless of any other bonuses, while a roll of 20 always succeeds. The DC varies based on the task:

- Easy: Spotting a large Ogre crouched behind a small bush might be a DC 8 Perception check.
- Medium: A hidden doorway behind a bookcase might be a DC 12 Examination check.
- Challenging: Calming an injured Owlbear stuck in a trap may be a DC 15 Naturecraft check.
- Very Difficult: Intuiting the true intentions of a trained Spy may be a DC 18 Insight check.
- Extremely Difficult: Disarming an ancient legendary trap may be a DC 20+ Finesse check.

Saves. When the world affects you , roll a save instead of a skill check. Roll 1d20 and add the relevant stat. A roll of 1 always fails, 20 always saves. You can choose to fail any save instead of rolling.

- DEX Save. When your agility or speed is tested. DEX helps you dive for cover in an explosion or stay on your feet while running across icy terrain.
- INT Save. When your intelligence is tested. INT helps you see though tricks and illusions.
- WIL Save. When your courage or personality is tested. WIL helps you resist charm or fear effects.

## Heroes and Saves

- Unless otherwise noted, the DC for effects a hero causes is 10+KEY .
- When making saves, each hero has 1 advantaged save (+), 1 disadvantaged save (-), and 2 neutral saves.
- STR Save. When your overall fitness and physicality is tested. STR helps resist forced movement, restraint, poison, and extreme temperatures.

Example. A Berserker (STR+, INT-) would roll all of his STR saves with advantage and all of his INT saves with disadvantage (see next page).

## Size

Some spells and abilities affect differently sized objects or creatures. For size, use the following guidelines:

- Tiny can be carried in a typical pocket (many can comfortably fit in 1 space).
- Small can be carried in a backpack (2 can comfortably fit in 1 space).
- Medium is the average human size (1 can comfortably fit in 1 space).
- Large is roughly the size of a bear (1 can comfortably fit in a 2x2 area).
- Huge is roughly the size of a small house (1 can comfortably fit in a 3x3 area).
- Gargantuan can be as large as a castle keep (1 can fill a 4x4 area or greater).

## Advantage & Disadvantage

If you are ever in a favorable situation, the GM may allow you to roll with advantage. To do this, roll 1 additional die of the same type and remove the lowest (see examples below). Alternatively, if the situation is grim or your idea is a long shot, you may have to roll with disadvantage (removing the highest die instead).

If you have multiple instances of advantage or disadvantage, for each one, roll an extra die and remove the lowest (for advantage) or the highest (for disadvantage). Each instance of advantage cancels out one instance of disadvantage before you roll.

Example 1. Greataxe (2d6) with advantage. Roll 1 additional die and remove the lowest. You hit! See attack rules on pg. 13 for more.

Example 2. Greataxe (2d6) with disadvantage 2. Roll 2 additional dice, remove the 2 highest. If there is a tie, always remove dice from left to right. You miss!

## Hit Points & Dying

Hit Points (HP) represent your ability to endure damage. Damage reduces your HP (which can't go below 0). When reduced to 0 HP, gain 1 Wound; you also gain the Dying condition until you regain HP. While Dying, actions are limited to 1, Concentration is broken, and you are at risk of further serious harm:

- Attacking/casting spells causes 1 Wound unless you make a DC 10 STR save .
- Taking damage while Dying causes 2 Wounds; a crit causes 3 instead.

## Wounds

Wounds are serious injuries you've taken; they are a long term gauge of how close you are to death. HP can usually be recovered quickly, but Wounds may take many days of resting to fully recover from (usually 1/Safe Rest).

## Death

You die when you have taken 6 Wounds (unless you have an ability that changes this number). There are ways to revive a hero who has died, but they are rare and often come at a very steep cost.

## Temporary HP

Some abilities or effects may grant temporary HP (temp HP); these are reduced first when taking damage. Temp HP do not combine: If a hero has temp HP and would gain more, they instead choose which amount to keep. They expire after a Safe Rest.

## Hit Dice

Hit Dice (HD) represent your ability to quickly recuperate from minor injuries and are spent to regain HP. Heroes start with a max of 1 Hit Die at level 1, and this limit increases by 1 each time they level up. Hit Dice are recovered during a Safe Rest (see 'RESTING & DOWNTIME' on page 17).

Gritty Dying Rules. Optional rules for a more challenging or 'old school' style of game: You can reduce the max number of Wounds heroes have. Anywhere from a max of 5 Wounds for slightly harder, all the way down to 1-2 Wounds for a very lethal game! 00

You can also have each Wound impose a cumulative -1 penalty to rolls: skill checks, saves, or even ALL rolls! (If you're a real glutton for punishment.)

## Speed & Range

A character's Speed is how fast they can move, which, unless otherwise noted, is 6 . Often play is done on a grid with 1 inch squares or hexagons representing roughly 5 ft. or 1 meter each. So a hero with a speed of 6 can travel up to 6 spaces horizontally or diagonally.

You can move through spaces occupied by allies (or enemies as difficult terrain: half speed), as long as you don't end movement in an occupied space.

Alternate Options. For a quicker, more loose game, you can forego counting spaces and measure typical movement roughly from pinkie to thumb. Slightly less for players

with large hands (or slower characters), a bit more for our tiny-handed friends (or faster characters).

## Range & Reach

Certain abilities, weapons, and spells have a specified Range or Reach, which determines how far away your target can be affected. If none is specified, default to Reach 1.

- In Melee. If any enemy is adjacent to you, your Ranged attacks are made with disadvantage (Reach attacks are not so affected).
- Long Range. You can gain disadvantage 1 to gain +2 Range on any Ranged attack (max +6).

## Falling & Forced Movement

When a character is forcibly moved but stopped by an obstacle, they take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every space this movement is shortened. If they hit another creature, both creatures split this damage. Falling inflicts 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 ft. fallen (2 spaces).

Abstracted Distances. If preferred, you can use a more abstracted system of distance just as well. Use Close , Midrange , and Far . A move from Midrange can traverse to Close or Far. Close creatures can be affected Reach/Range 4; Midrange, up to 6; beyond that is Far. As always, the GM will adjudicate unclear situations and which creatures are affected by abilities with an area of effect.

## Concentration

Some activities require Concentration to maintain. A character can only concentrate on one activity at a time. Whenever a character is crit while concentrating, they must make a DC 10 STR save . Failing this means Concentration is broken and the activity fails. Concentration is automatically broken whenever a character drops to 0 HP or is incapacitated.

## Cover & Hiding

A  creature  mostly  obscured from line of sight (standing behind a tree, a larger ally, a knocked over table, in poor lighting, etc.) has Cover and imposes disadvantage on attacks against them. A creature completely obscured from view has Full Cover and cannot typically be targeted by an attack.

To hide in combat, you must have Cover from the creatures you are attempting to hide from and use an action to make a DC 15 Stealth check (if you have Full Cover, you succeed automatically). The first attack you make while hidden is made with advantage, then you are no longer hidden. If this attack kills the enemy and no other enemy can see you, you may remain hidden instead.

Monsters Are Smart! They may catch on to heroes using the same tactics over and over again!

## Grappling

You can attempt to grab another creature provided you are within Reach and have at least 1 arm free (or some other way to grab them). On a failed STR or DEX save (DC 10+STR or DEX), a target:

- your size or smaller, is Grappled.
- larger than you, you gain the Riding condition.

Forced movement (pushing a grappler away), incapacitation, or spending an action and succeeding on a STR or DEX save can end it.



## Conditions

Some attacks, traps, spells, or other effects can also inflict conditions-usually negative effects other than damage. Some conditions are temporary, lasting as little as a single round; others may last until cured in some way, and some can be ended by using an action to make an appropriate save.

| Condition | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Blinded** | Can't see. Attacks against you have advantage, and your attacks have disadvantage. |
| **Bloodied** | At half HP or less. |
| **Charmed** | Sees the charmer as an ally. Charmer has advantage on social interactions with you. |
| **Dazed** | Heroes: lose 1 action; monsters: can perform one less action on their next turn. |
| **Dying** | At 0 HP. Taking damage while dying causes 2 Wounds; a crit causes 3 instead. |
| **Restrained** | Functions like Grappled, but is caused by objects (e.g., chains, rope, roots) and ignores size restrictions. It can also be ended through any logical means, such as picking a lock or cutting/burning rope. |
| **Frightened** | Disadvantage on rolls when source of fear is nearby; speed halved when moving closer to it. |
| **Grappled/Restrained** | Cannot move. Attacks against you have advantage. |
| **Hampered** | Any creature with their actions or movement reduced (e.g., Dazed, Grappled, Prone, Difficult Terrain). |
| **Incapacitated** | Can't do anything. Attacks against you have advantage, and melee attacks that hit, crit. |
| **Invisible** | Cannot be seen. Your attacks have advantage, and attacks against you have disadvantage. |
| **Petrified** | Incapacitated. You have all the benefits and drawbacks of being a rock! Immune to most damage except from large explosions, picks, or similar tools. |
| **Poisoned** | Disadvantage on rolls. |
| **Prone** | Movement costs twice as much, and disadvantage on attacks. Melee attacks against you have advantage; Ranged have disadvantage. Spend 3 spaces of your Speed to stand up. |
| **Riding** | You move with the creature you are riding. Any attacks that miss you, strike them. |
| **Slowed** | Speed halved during your next turn. |
| **Taunted** | Disadvantage on attacks except against the most recent taunter. |
| **Wounded** | Has any Wounds (typically 6 Wounds and a hero is dead). |
| **Other Minor Statuses** | Minor statuses (Smoldering, Charged, Distracted, etc.) do nothing on their own and end whenever combat does. Some spells and abilities have additional effects against such targets. |


## COMBAT

## Heroic Actions

On your turn, heroes get 3 actions to attack, move around the battlefield, cast spells, etc. Generally doing any single thing in combat costs 1 action. Some very strong spells or special abilities may take more time and thus cost more actions.

All 3 actions recharge at the end of your turn, so there's no need to save them up. Spend them all on your turn and when you're done, you get them all back!

## Attack

Any spell or ability that can harm an enemy counts as an attack. Roll the die listed on the spell, weapon, or ability, and deal that much damage. However, if you roll a 1, you miss, and the attack has no effect. For attacks with multiple dice, the leftmost die is called the Primary Die . It determines whether the attack is a hit or a miss.

Exploding Critical Hits. Rolling the max on a Primary Die is a critical hit (crit). When you crit, roll the Primary Die again, and add the result to the total. Repeat this each time you roll the maximum-there's no limit, except your luck! Crits also ignore monster armor (see pg. 15).

Rushed Attacks. A hero may attack more than once on their turn, but these additional attacks are rushed, imposing cumulative disadvantage for each additional attack after the first-increasing the chance to miss and lowering the average damage for subsequent attacks. For abilities that trigger a save (e.g. Grappling),  enemies roll with increasing instances of advantage instead.

## Cast Spell

Casting a spell requires a hero to have 1 hand free (or a held spellcasting focus), the ability to speak, and may require mana as well. A spell's mana cost is equal to its spell tier; cantrips cost no mana (see 'Spells' on page 45 for more).

Upcasting Spells. Some spells have a greater effect for each additional mana spent on them. A hero can upcast a spell only up to the tier they have unlocked.

## Move

A character can move up to their speed (6 spaces, unless otherwise noted). This  movement can be broken up with other actions if desired, and a hero can use multiple actions to Move multiple times in one turn. When in Difficult Terrain , movement speed is halved. Moving on a climbable surface (trees, a cliffside, certain buildings, etc.) counts as Difficult Terrain.

## Assess

A great way to include creativity and role-playing in combat. Choose one of the following and then make a DC 12 skill check to:

| Ask a Question | About a weakness, ability, or immediate plans of enemies, the environment, story, etc. The GM will answer honestly. |
|---|---|
| Create an Opening | Increase the next Primary Die Roll against a target by 1 this round. |
| Anticipate Danger | Reduce all Primary Dice rolled against you by 1 this round. |

__Which Skill To Use?__ Whatever skill you use must make sense based on the circumstances. For example, if you're close to an enemy, you could use Might to create an opening, but against an enemy that is far away, that may not make sense. Or if you want to ask a question about the weaknesses of an elemental, you'd likely use Arcana.

Monsters Are Smart! You cannot assess using the same skill more than once in a single encounter, as your foes adapt to your tactics. You'll need to stay creative!

Free Actions. These do not cost an action or any other resource (e.g., mana) unless otherwise specified. Heroes can do simple tasks (open an unlocked door, shout a simple phrase, drop an item, end concentration, etc.) for free 1/ turn.

## Heroic Reactions

Reactions cost 1 action and are performed when it is not your turn. A hero can perform each reaction no more than 1/round, and they will start their turn with fewer actions. The reactions are:

## Defend

Reduce damage from any single attack by your Armor whenever you use this reaction.  At  the  GM's  discretion, some damage may not be avoidable (e.g., psychic damage, or some areas of effect).

## Interpose

If a creature within 2 spaces would be struck with an attack, you can push them out of the way and become the new target of the attack. You enter their space and move them to an adjacent space of your choice.

Interpose AND Defend? Yes! As long as you have enough actions to spend, you can Interpose and Defend at the same time. However, you won't be able to do either reaction again until your next turn is over since each of those is limited to 1/round.

## Opportunity Attack

A melee attack made with disadvantage against an adjacent enemy as it willingly moves away. Monsters do not make opportunity attacks, only heroes can.

## Help

Grant an ally advantage on a roll if you can reasonably explain to the GM how you could help in a given situation (limit: one Help reaction for each roll). The GM may call for a skill check or grant advantage automatically, depending on how good the idea is.

Teamwork! Help as a Heroic Reaction is a fantastic way to bring teamwork, role-playing, and creativity into a combat encounter. Did your buddy fail? Maybe not! Think quickly and see if you can help them succeed.

## Monsters & Armor

Most monsters are unarmored, but some tougher foes might have armor:

|Tier|Effect|
|---|---|
| Medium Armor | Mobs take damage from only the dice rolled, ignoring all damage modifiers (unless they are negative). |
| Heavy Armor | Mobs take only half the damage from the dice , likewise ignoring damage modifiers.|

## Minions

Minions are weak enemies that will die from any amount of damage. They move and attack at the same time, cannot crit, and their feeble attacks can be Defended against as if they were a single attack. Dealing a large amount of damage to a minion can (at the GM's discretion) overflow to other minions within range as well.

Crits and damage vulnerabilities ignore monster armor. This means that different heroes and different weapons, spells, and abilities will be more or less effective against various kinds of armor.

## Starting Combat

A combat encounter begins when the GM tells the party to 'Roll Initiative!' Each hero rolls 1d20 and adds their Initiative bonus (typically their DEX). A single digit means they start combat with 1 action. 2 digits, they start combat with 2. A result of 20+ (or a natural 20) means they get all 3 actions! Regardless of what a hero rolls on Initiative, at the end of their turn they gain all 3 actions back.

Surprise. Occasionally a party may maneuver  themselves so adeptly that their enemy is completely caught off guard. In this case, the GM may grant the party advantage on Initiative, or in extreme cases, they may not need to roll Initiative at all-the GM can allow each Hero to start with all 3 actions!

A Note on Surprise. Merely being hidden or punching first is not sufficient to gain Surprise! If an enemy is on guard or at all aware of your presence, they cannot be surprised.

If the heroes are surprised,  they  may have  to  roll  with disadvantage. Or, in extreme cases, the  heroes  may automatically start combat with only  1  action,  or the monsters may all go first.

## Turn Order

When combat begins, by default, the heroes go first. Whichever player is ready first goes first (or whoever makes the most sense story-wise), with play proceeding around the table clockwise.

Monsters will typically act last, though some monsters may be fast enough to act sooner in the round. A monster (or monster group) should act at the same time each round.

Encourage teamwork, be flexible. If  players want to strategically switch their turns for one round to facilitate teamwork or execute a tactical plan, the GM can allow this at his/her discretion. This should be done only occasionally, though, to avoid slowing the game down or losing track of who has taken their turn.

Playing virtually? You can go in webcam order, alphabetically, or however is easiest to track!

## Turns, Rounds, & Encounters

A Turn is  when  1  individual  hero  or  monster group acts. A typical turn takes roughly 6 seconds of 'in-world' time. A Round is when all players and monsters have taken a turn acting. An Encounter is all of the rounds in a particular combat.

1/Turn Abilities. If you perform one on your turn, and can find a way to perform it on another creature's turn, you can do it again (e.g., Sneak Attack combined with  Opportunity  Attack  or  Coordinated  Strike!).

1/Round Abilities. These reset whenever your own turn begins (e.g., when you Defend, you cannot do so again until your turn comes back around).

## Acting Over Multiple Turns

For activities that cost more than 1 action, your actions can be spent over multiple turns in combat as long as Concentration is maintained and you do not perform other actions or reactions in the meantime (unless they are free).

Example. Book, the Mage, wants to cast Glacier Strike (3 actions), but only has 1 action left. He'll spend 1 action on this turn to start casting the spell, and on his next turn spend 2 more to finish casting it. He's taking a risk, though: he can't Defend himself and may need to rely on his party to protect him.

RESTING & DOWNTIME

| Type | Rest | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Field | Catch Breath | Requires at least 10 minutes to tend to your injuries. Expend any number of Hit Dice one at a time (roll them and add your STR to each), and regain that many HP. |
| Field | Make Camp | If you rest for at least 8 hours with food and sleep, take the maximum value for each Hit Die you expend instead of rolling. Add your STR to each Hit Die as usual. |
| Safe | Safe Rest | After a Safe Rest, heroes recover all of their HP, Hit Dice, mana (and other class-specific resources), and heal 1 Wound. Safe Rests are a great opportunity for downtime activities as well. |

## Field Rests

While out adventuring, heroes can take Field Rests to regain HP.

> What if I Have Negative STR? Your frail body doesn't recover as quickly as others. Subtract your STR from each HD you expend.

## Safe Rests

Safe Rests take place in a safe location designated by your GM, typically lodging at an inn overnightbut could also be at a secret oasis, a well-stocked cabin in the woods, near a sacred shrine, or the like. Camping in the open wilderness or in a dungeon is not sufficient for gaining the benefits of a Safe Rest.

> Rest for HOW Long? ! If your table prefers to largely skip downtime activities and narrate past a week of resting, that's okay too! For a more realistic convalescence time, 1 week per wound recovered may make more sense.

## Lodging

The cheapest rooms at an inn save you money but may lead to complications. On the other hand, some inns may allow you to pay a premium for a nicer room and amenities, giving you a Temporary Boon. Typical prices (each person/day): Poor (5 sp), Comfortable (2 gp), and Lavish (10 gp). Lavish inns allow players to gain one Temporary Boon the following day (see Lodging Boons table on pg. 22 of the GM's Guide ).

## Downtime

The  time  you  aren't  out  adventuring  is  called Downtime . You can spend Downtime to recuperate from your adventures and partake in Downtime Activities. Not every moment of Downtime needs to be narrated or roleplayed. Much Downtime can be skipped over to get back to adventuring if desired. Example Downtime Activities:


| Activity | Effect|
|:---:|---|
| Retrain | Spend time doing activities to retrain any of your chosen abilities, features, or if it makes sense in the story, possibly even your subclass.|
| Gather Information  | NPCs, pick up news, or collect rumors and job leads.|
| Personal Goals | Pursue goals from your backstory or other smaller quests you've chosen.|
| Buy & Sell | Get new equipment, and sell treasures you've collected while out adventuring.|
| Perform | Play music, tell stories, compete, or perform in public to earn gold or fame.|
| Craft  |Create weapons, armor, or simple items using materials you've acquired.|
| Socialize  |Build alliances, make new friends, or make new enemies.|
| Invest | Use your gold to invest in businesses or trade ventures for future profit.|
| Mentor  |Teach a skill or ability to another character or NPC.|
| Research | Investigate a mystery, study ancient texts, or uncover hidden knowledge.|
| Serve | Aid a patron or a deity in exchange for a favor, or perform charity for townsfolk.|
| Build | Establish a home base, start a business, craft siege weapons, or build anything else you can imagine (GM and setting-permitting, of course).|

CHARACTER CREATION

## Making A Hero

Your hero is how you will make your mark on the world. Here's how you can make your own hero:

Step 1: Choose Your Class. This will have the largest impact on the other  character choices you make and how you interact with the world (see the Heroes book for more details):

- BERSERKER. An unstoppable force of wrath and ruin.
- THE CHEAT. Sneaky, backstabbing, dirty-fighting rogue.
- COMMANDER. A battlefield tactician, leader, and weapon master.
- HUNTER. Resourceful survivalist, bow master, and skilled tracker.
- MAGE. Wield and shape the elements of fire, ice, and lightning.
- OATHSWORN. Faithful guardian, protector, and avenger of the weak.
- SHADOWMANCER. Summon hordes of expendable minions.
- SHEPHERD. Master life and death. Lead a faithful companion.
- SONGWEAVER. Inspiring presence, sharp wit, sharper tongue.
- STORMSHIFTER. Master of weather, beast, and nature.
- ZEPHYR. A disciplined martial artist with swift hands and swift feet.

Step 2: Choose Your Ancestry & Background (and optionally, choose your adventuring motivation). What made your hero want to start adventuring? How do you know the other heroes?

Step 3: Fill in Your Character Sheet. This handy sheet of paper helps you track your stats, abilities, loot, and other important game info (see pg. 21).

## The Character Sheet

## 1. Basic Details & Stats

Fill in your character details: Name, Ancestry, Class, Level, Height, and Weight. Fill in the arrow for your advantaged (+) and disadvantaged (-) Saves, and choose a stat array (recommended: place the highest numbers in the KEY stats for your class).

- Standard: +2, +2, +0, -1

- Balanced: +2, +1, +1, +0

- Min-Max: +3, +1, -1, -1

Example. The Cheat has DEX and INT as their KEY stats. With the Min-Max array, you might put +3 in DEX, +1 in INT, and -1 in WIL and STR. You'd also mark ▲ for DEX saves and ▼ for WIL saves.

## 2. Skill Points

At level 1, mark your stat bonuses into each of your respective skills (e.g., a hero with +2 DEX would mark +2 in Finesse and Stealth), and then may place 4 additional skill points wherever you like.

Example. If you have -1 INT; mark -1 for Arcana, Examination, and Lore. Repeat for your other stats. Then, with your 4 extra points, you could increase Stealth and Finesse by +2 each; any 4 skills by 1 each; or dump all 4 points into your favorite single skill. Up to you!

## 3. Secondary Stats

Mark your max HP and Hit Dice size (see your class), Hit Die amount (default: equal to your level), Initiative (default: DEX), Size, Speed (default: 6), max Wounds (default: 6), and inventory slots (10+STR).

## 4. Equipment & Money

Heroes start at level 1 with the equipment listed for their class and background OR 50 gp to buy their starting equipment. If starting at a higher level, multiply that by the level you are starting at.

But my character is a wealthy noble! That's fine, but your character only has access to this amount of gold for now. Why your wealth is currently inaccessible is up to you and your GM; unlocking your full riches could be a great quest!

## 5. Languages

All heroes speak Common by default. Each point of INT grants you an additional language known. These languages are typically spoken by:

- Common. Most intelligent creatures.
- Dwarvish. Dwarves, Gnomes, and Giants.
- Elvish. Elves, Fey, and Sylvan.
- Goblin. Goblins and Orcs.
- Infernal. Various Fiends and cultists.
- Thieves' Cant. Scoundrels and rogues.
- Celestial. Celestials and priests.
- Draconic. Dragons, Dragonborn, and Kobolds.
- Primordial. Elementals and Ancient Beings.
- Deep Speak. Underworld dwellers.

GROFWINT DRAZLON! Speaking another creature's language can open doors that weapons alone cannotbeing heavily armed without the ability to communicate often leads to hostility.

## 6. Other Abilities

Mark any other special abilities you get from your class, ancestry, background, etc.

## 7. Inventory Slots

Each hero has 10+STR inventory slots for carrying equipment and loot (held, worn, or in a pack).

- 1 slot can hold a one-handed weapon, shield, worn armor, stack of javelins, 500 gp, or 2 potions.
- 2 slots can hold a 2-handed weapon, unworn armor, or similarly bulky items.
- Small, related items can be grouped into one slot for simplicity (e.g., Camping Supplies: soap, blanket, brush, rations).

On Ammunition. In most games, there's no need to track ammo. If you have a quiver, you have enough arrows. Assume the hero collects fired arrows, crafts more, or buys them in town.

Alternatively, your GM may allow you to carry what you want without the bookkeeping, so long as you're reasonable!

## Leveling Up

The GM may allow you to gain a level (LVL) whenever you complete an appropriately challenging quest or adventure. At level 1, this may be as simple as clearing some angry rats out of a basement or rescuing someone from the woods. Each subsequent level will generally take more effort (and therefore more time). When a hero gains a level:

- HP Increase. Roll your Hit Die with advantage and increase your max HP by that much.
- More Endurance. Your Hit Die max increases by 1 (it is typically equal to your level).
- More Skilled. Gain 1 skill point. Additionally, you may move 1 point from one skill to another (as long as the skill doesn't become negative), reflecting your hero's evolving expertise and priorities.

Note. The maximum bonus a skill can have is +12.

ANCESTRY & BACKGROUND

## Common Ancestries

Your kin, lineage, heritage, or race-this is how your character was born and how others see you at first glance. You may be a dwarf raised in the mines under the mountain with countless other dwarves, or you may be an elf raised by goblins! It's up to you to choose how your character began. Choose 1 ancestry and add its bonus to your character sheet.

## Human (Medium)

Found in every terrain and environment, their curiosity and ambition drive them to explore every corner of the world, making them a ubiquitous and versatile race.

Tenacious. +1 to all skills and Initiative.

## Dwarf (Medium)

Dwarf, in the old language, means 'stone.' You are resilient, solid, stout. Even when driven to exhaustion, you will not falter. Forgoing speed, you are gifted with physical vitality and a belly that can handle the finest (and worst) consumables this world has to offer.

Stout. +2 max Hit Dice, +1 max Wounds, -1 Speed. You know Dwarvish if your INT is not negative.

## Elf (Medium)

Elves epitomize swiftness and grace. Their tall, slender forms belie their innate speed, grace, and wit. Formidable in both diplomacy and combat, elves strike swiftly, often preventing the worst by acting first.

Lithe. Advantage on Initiative, +1 Speed. You know Elvish if your INT is not negative.

What About Half-Elves? Mix the ancestries however makes sense in your world. You can pick one ancestral bonus and use it instead of both, or use both half as effectively or half as often.

## Halfling (Small)

Kind of like a human, but smaller (except for the feet). Where does our luck come from? Well…you know what they say about rabbit feet? Well, we've got feet for days compared to them. Imagine the amount of luck you could fit into these bad boys! Elusive. +1 to Stealth. If you fail a save, you can succeed instead, 1/Safe Rest.

## Gnome (Small)

Eccentric, curious, and perpetually optimistic, gnomes are cheerful-especially when compared to their typically grumpier and larger kin, the dwarves. Known for their tinkering, spread ing cheer, and playful antics, gnomes pursue their passions with a scatterbrained enthusiasm.

Optimistic. Allow an ally within Reach 6 to reroll any single die, resets when healed to your max HP. -1 Speed. You know Dwarvish if your INT is not negative (but you call it Gnomish, of course).

Flavor Is Free. Want to play a Stout Halfling instead of an Elusive one? An Optimistic Human instead of Tenacious? As long as it makes sense and the GM is on board, go for it!

## Exotic Ancestries

Your setting may or may not support these choices-check with your GM first before selecting one.

## Bunbun (Small)

Bunbun are agile and unpredictable, using their powerful legs to leap great distances and catch foes off guard. Facing a Bunbun means contending with an opponent who can strike from unexpected angles and swiftly reposition themselves in the heat of battle.

Bunny Legs. Before Interposing or after Defending (after damage), hop up to your Speed in any direction for free, 1/encounter.

## Dragonborn (Medium)

The soul of a dragon burns within you, the scales of your body are like forged steel. You are a kiln and your heritage the coals that stoke your flames. Call upon your wrath, to speak in the tongue of your ancestors and imbue unbridled fury into your attacks.

Draconic Heritage. +1 Armor. When you attack: deal  an  additional  LVL+KEY  damage  (ignoring armor) divided as you choose among any of your targets; recharges whenever you Safe Rest or gain a Wound. You know Draconic if your INT is not negative.

## Fiendkin (Medium)

Said to have been born from the union of man and fiend, or from a cursed bloodline, Fiendkin often find themselves outcasts in society. Yet, they embody determination in the face of adversity. Their ancestors didn't emerge from the depths of the Everflame to succumb to minor setbacks!

Flameborn. 1 of your neutral saves is advantaged instead. You know Infernal if your INT is not negative.

## Goblin (Small)

Green, cunning, and perpetually vilified, Goblins thrive on the edge of chaos. For a Goblin, vanishing into the shadows is not just a skill-it's an identity. After all, what kind of Goblin would you be if you couldn't slip away unnoticed?

Skedaddle. Can move 2 spaces for free after you become the target of an attack or negative effect (after damage, ignoring difficult terrain). You know Goblin if your INT is not negative.

## Kobold (Small)

Small,  often  maniacal,  and  dragon-obsessed. Kobolds thrive in the shadows, finding ingenious ways to survive despite their diminutive size. Underestimated by many, Kobolds prove time and again that even the smallest among us can wield great power.

Wily. Force an enemy to reroll a non-critical attack against you, 1/encounter. +3 to Influence friendly characters. Advantage on skill checks related to dragons. You know Draconic if your INT is not negative.

## Orc (Medium)

Just when you think you've bested a mighty Orc, you've merely succeeded in rousing their anger. Engaging in combat with an Orc is no endeavor for the weak-willed. While others may cower before death's  approach,  Orcs  boldly  defy  its  grasp.

Relentless. When you would drop to 0 HP, you may set your HP to LVL instead, 1/Safe Rest. +1 Might. You know Goblin if your INT is not negative (but you call it Orcish, of course).

Flavor Is Free. Want to be a leaping Frogfolk instead of a Bunbun? A Flameborn Kobold? A winged Fairy instead of a Birdfolk? A Badgerfolk instead of a Stoatling? As long as it makes sense and your GM is game, go for it!

26

## Birdfolk (Small or Medium)

Birdfolk find sanctuary not in stone or chains, but within the boundless expanse of the sky. However, the gift of flight comes at a cost-hollow bones, and commensurate frailty.

Hollow Bones. You have a fly Speed as long as you are wearing armor no heavier than Leather. Crits against you are Vicious (the attacker rolls 1 additional die). Forced movement moves you twice as far.

## Celestial (Medium)

Descendants of divine beings, Celestials carry an aura of nobility and grace. Their innate connection to the higher planes allows them to resist the effects of misfortune, standing strong where others may falter.

Highborn. Your disadvantaged save is Neutral instead. You know Celestial if your INT isn't negative.

## Changeling (Medium)

Often hunted for their silver blood, Changelings are natural survivors, slipping into new identities with ease. Changelings that shift too often typically aren't long for the world-they can struggle to remember who they once were, becoming little more than reflections of the faces they wear.

New Place, New Face. +2 shifting skill points. You may take on the appearance of any ancestry. When you do, you may place your 2 shifting skill points into any 1 skill. 1/day.

## Crystalborn (Medium)

Formed from living crystal, the Crystalborn are beings of dazzling beauty and otherworldly toughness. Their translucent bodies refract light and sound, granting them unique abilities in combat.

Reflective Aura. When you Defend, gain KEY armor and deal KEY damage back to the attacker. 1/encounter.

## Dryad/Shroomling (Small or Med)

Tied to the natural world, Dryads and Shroomlings embody the balance between flora and fauna. Their unique physiology releases toxic spores when harmed, providing a natural defense against those who dare to harm them.

Danger Pollen/Spores. Whenever an enemy causes you one or more Wounds, you excrete soporific spores: all adjacent enemies are Dazed. You know Elvish if your INT is not negative.

## Half-Giant (Large)

Towering beings whose strength is as immovable as the mountains they call home. Their sheer size and resilience make them fearsome opponents, capable of surviving even devastating blows.

Strength of Stone. Force an enemy to reroll a crit against you, 1/encounter. +2 Might. You know Dwarvish if your INT is not negative.

## Minotaur/Beastfolk (Medium)

Minotaur and other Beastfolk embody a primal connection to The Wild , combining strength with natural agility. Their powerful build allows them to move swiftly, whether repositioning to outflank foes or charging in with unstoppable force.

Charge. When you move at least 4 spaces, you can push a creature in your path. Medium: 1 space; Small/Tiny: up to 2 spaces. 1/turn.

## Oozeling/Construct (Small or Med)

What even is a 'PeOpLe' anyway? So what if your heart pumps oil instead of blood, so what if you don't even have a heart!? If you can squish yourself into a pair of pants, or swing a sword like everyone else, who's to say you can't be a pEOpLe, too?! Odd Constitution. Increment your Hit Dice one step (d6 » d8 » d10 » d12 » d20); they always heal you for the maximum amount. Magical healing always heals you for the minimum amount.

## Planarbeing (Medium)

You are not from this plane of existence-your soul is not as strongly tethered to it as others. But with this vulnerability comes power, the ability to temporarily shift from one plane to another in times of dire need.

Planeshift. Whenever you Defend, you can gain 1 Wound to temporarily phase out of the material plane and ignore the damage. -2 max Wounds.

## Ratfolk (Small)

Ratfolk  are  survivors,  thriving in the shadows of society where  others  fear  to  tread. Agile, resourceful, and fiercely loyal to their own, they have a knack  for  turning  scraps  into solutions.

Scurry. Gain +2 armor if you moved on your last turn.

## Stoatling (Small)

Stoatlings may be small, but they're far from weak. With fierce determination and warrior hearts, they can take down foes many times their size.  Their  agility  and  tenacity  let them exploit larger enemies' weaknesses, turning their size into a lethal advantage.

Small But Ferocious. Whenever you make a single-target attack against a creature larger than you, roll 1 additional  d6  for  each  size  category  it  is larger. They do the same.

## Turtlefolk (Small or Med)

Turtlefolk take their time in everything they do; they are patient, sturdy, and slow to anger. They rely on their thick shells for protection, making them difficult to harm, but their cautious movements come at the cost of speed.

Slow & Steady. +4 Armor, -2 speed.

## Wyrdling (Small)

Unpredictable and chaotic, Wyrdlings are the result of magic gone awry. Their bodies pulse with raw arcane energy, and their mere presence often disturbs the balance of magic around them.

Chaotic Surge. Whenever you or a willing ally within Reach 6 casts a tiered spell, you may allow them to roll on the  Chaos Table. 1/encounter.

## Backgrounds

Backgrounds provide a glimpse into your character's past-how they were raised, the skills they honed before becoming an adventurer, or even their defining personality traits. Feel free to adapt or reimagine these backgrounds to suit your character's story. Choose 1 background:

Back Out of Retirement. You've forgotten more than most adventurers these days know! Talk with your GM, what made you come out of retirement?

- Let's see if I remember how to do this... You may gain 1 Wound to use an ability or cast a spell as if you were 1 level higher.
- These old bones. Your age has long since started to show. -1 max Wounds.

Devoted Protector. Choose 1 ally in your party. You can survive +3 max Wounds as long as they are nearby. Whenever they take a Wound, you do too.

Academy Dropout. School just isn't for everyone! You learn by experience in the real world (or at least that's what you tell yourself). Learn any 1 Utility Spell.

Made a BAD Choice. Start with 500 or 1000 extra gold, or an uncommon/rare magical item (that your GM allows). Gain an equally powerful curse or enemy who wants it back. If you choose this background, your GM may allow you to choose another.

Haunted Past. You are haunted by voices that occasionally give you cryptic advice. The voices are sometimes VERY helpful. Other times they only want to see you suffer. Advantage against fear.

Ear to the Ground. Advantage on checks to know or obtain gossip for events that will soon happen or have happened less than 1 year ago.

What? I've Been Around. 1/per location (or at the GM's discretion). You happen to know JUST the person who has the information you're looking for, or could get you out of a jam, and… Roll 1d20:

- 1-5. They want you DEAD.
- 6-12. You owe them money.
- 13-19. They can be convinced to help you..
- 20. They are your biggest fan/are madly in love with you.

Acrobat. Can be thrown by a larger ally, REALLY far. Half damage from falling and forced movement.

Wild One. Whether it is the sticks or flowers in your hair, your smell, or the way you carry yourself, wild creatures are less frightened of you and more willing to aid you. +1 Naturecraft. While Field Resting, roll your Hit Dice with advantage while in the wild.

Fey Touched. You take half damage from all magical effects, double from weapons made of metal (before armor is applied).

Survivalist. You never run out of your own personal rations. Anything can be food if you try hard enough! Advantage against poison saves. +1 max Hit Die.

Home at Sea. Recover twice as many Wounds and HP while resting on a ship or near water. You can fill in for a first mate or captain in a pinch. Advantage on water-related skill checks.

At Home Underground. You can dig twice as fast as others. Safe resting locations underground always count as Lavish lodging for you. You struggle to rest (INT save) while it's raining. 'Water… from the SKY?!'

Raised by Goblins. You speak Goblin natively (much better than one who has learned it later in life). You automatically notice and can avoid crudely-made traps and have advantage to notice and disarm more sophisticated traps.

Change It Up! You can choose any other ancestry to be raised by instead, and exchange the known language and get 1 helpful/iconic ability those people would inculcate (e.g., Dwarves know Dwarvish and are very good with smithing or stonecraft).

History Buff. Advantage on all Lore checks related to knowledge about items, facts, or events that happened more than 100 years ago.

(Former) Con Artist. You can forge most documents or mimic voices flawlessly. You have a criminal contact in most major cities. However, your reputation often precedes you-until you prove yourself to be trustworthy.

(Secretly) Undead. Unnatural Resilience: You are immune to disease and do not need to eat, drink, or breathe. Children, animals, and Celestials are uneasy in your presence; many will be horrified to discover your true nature.

Taste for the Finer Things. You always have up-to-date knowledge of the customs and dress of the upper classes and may even know many of their secrets. Advantage on Influence checks with the upper class.

Make It Your Own! Remember, backgrounds are just a starting point-you're free to adjust, reimagine, or completely rewrite them to suit your character's story. If you want to know a Utility Spell but don't like the Academy Dropout flavor, come up with a different reason why your character might know it. Maybe they learned it from a traveling bard or discovered it etched into an ancient relic.

Feel free to swap traits, change the flavor text, or blend backgrounds together. Haunted Past might become Blessed by Spirits if your character views their otherworldly voices as guardians rather than tormentors.

Work with your GM to ensure any changes align with your game's setting and are balanced with other backgrounds. These are here to inspire creativity-what you build with them is entirely up to you!

Fearless. You are immune to the Frightened condition. +1 Initiative. -1 Armor.

So Dumb I'm Smart Sometimes. (Req.  0 or negative INT at character creation.) Reroll an INT-related skill check, 1/day. Reroll a failed INT save with advantage, 1/Safe Rest.

Wily Underdog. (Req. 0 or negative STR at character creation.) Reroll a failed STR-related roll (e.g., STR attack, STR save, Might check) and use another stat instead, 1/day.

Bumblewise. (Req. 0 or negative WIL at character creation.) A result of 1 or less on any WIL-related roll counts as a natural 20 (WIL save, Naturecraft, Perception, Influence, or Insight check).

Accidental Acrobat. (Req. 0 or negative DEX at character creation.) Whenever you fail a DEX-related roll (e.g., DEX attack, DEX save, Stealth check, Finesse check), you may roll again. If you still fail, the consequences are BAD.

Tradesman/Artisan. Choose a profession (Baker/Cook, Smith, Stonemason, Weaver, Leatherworker, etc.). Checks you make related to that profession are made with advantage. You also retain special knowledge related to your profession.

ADVENTURING MOTIVATION

ARTIST: JUSTIN GERARD

## Adventuring Motivation

The world is a dangerous place-people don't usually just 'go adventuring' without a reason. Your motivation should make your character want to work with the rest of the group.

I  owe  a  life  debt  to  someone  in  my party. Chat with your party: Who else needs help with their backstory? What did they do to help you?

I owe a LOT of money to some very dangerous people. What did you do with the money? Your GM probably has some GREAT ideas of bad guys you're in deep with.

I need to grow in power to defeat someone who has wronged me. Do you know who wronged you, or are they unknown? Is it an individual or a larger group? Chat with your GM; they'll love to help fill in the blanks.

I am searching for a way to bring a loved one (or someone I hate) back from the dead. Who even told you this was possible? What if they don't remember you?

I am trying to get back home. Where is home for you, do you even remember? What caused you to leave? Chat with your GM; they can give you some options of homelands.

I am searching for the one who stole something valuable from me. Is  it  an object? A person? A memory? Was it really stolen or did you make a bad bargain?

I was polymorphed into another kind of creature by a wizard. Hah! How would it feel for a cute halfling to become an ugly goblin? What did you do to anger the wizard?

Duty calls. I am honor-bound to serve. Who calls you? Your king? Your family? An ancient alliance or grudge? Talk with your GM and other players for ideas and mutual connections.

I was best friends with (and betrayed by) \_\_\_\_\_\_. Do you want to win them back? Get even? Warn others of their backstabbing? Talk with your GM about who this might be.

I'm lost. Physically? Emotionally? Spiritually? Are you in the wrong country or even plane of existence?

Wanderlust/Pilgrimage. What amazing thing do you want to see or experience? Have you spent too much time away from the road? Your GM probably has some fantastic locations in mind for you.

My home town is in danger. Are  you looking for a cure? Mercenaries? Personal strength?

Curiosity!  I  want  to  learn  the  DEEP secrets. Which secrets? Magical, lore, politics, what really happened in history?

To prove my worth. You were always underestimated-by your family, your village, your peers, or yourself. What will it take to show them you're more than they thought? What kind of recognition do you seek?

I'm following a prophecy. A mysterious figure or ancient text foretold that you would play a crucial role in the fate of the world. What do you know of the prophecy? Do you believe it?

Or Make Your Own! A great character background has connections with the world, its people, your fellow heroes, or even the bad guys.  Work with your GM and fellow players to find a motivation that will cross paths with where the story goes. Every good hero has a desire. What's yours?

## EQUIPMENT

ARTIST: TSTUDIO

## Equipment

Equipment Proficiency. Heroes can use any equipment they like; however, each class has a list of weapons and armor types they are most skilled with. Weapons used without proficiency cannot crit. Defending while wearing armor worn without proficiency costs 1 additional action.

Swapping Equipment. A hero can sheathe weapons or shields they are proficient with and equip a different one for free 1/round.

## Armor

Armor represents your hero's ability to dodge or block damage when you use the Defend reaction. While unarmored or wearing regular clothes, your Armor is equal to your DEX . Some items may grant additional Armor while equipped.

Defend Yourself! If you're standing right next to a baddie with an axe and you're not doing anything to defend yourself, chances are, you're going to get axed! (See the 'Defend' heroic reaction on pg. 15)

| Shield  | Dragon Shield (Req. 3STR)     | 8            | 9,000gp  |

Deflect! An  optional  rule  for  additional defensive flexibility: instead of adding your shield's armor to your total armor as normal, you may reduce the damage of an attack by your shield's armor value for free 1/round.

## Weapon Properties

- 2-handed. Can be held in a single hand, but must be wielded in 2 hands to attack with it.
- Load. Some weapons require extra actions to load before each shot.
- Reach. How close an enemy must be to be affected by this attack. If unspecified, Reach 1.
- Range. Attacks can be made from afar. If any enemy is adjacent to you, your Ranged attacks are made with disadvantage. Add 1 die of disadvantage to gain +2 Range.
- Thrown. Treat a melee weapon as if it had Range. Once thrown, you no longer have it!
- Vicious. Roll 1 additional die whenever you roll crit damage.

Remember! Only the Primary Die (the leftmost one) is used for determining whether an attack crits. Every time you roll crit damage, roll the additional Vicious die as well!

## Dual Wielding

Heroes may wield 2 Light weapons at the same time. While dual wielding, you may gain advantage on an attack with those weapons, 1/round.

You may dual wield 1-handed weapons without the Light property if your STR is 3 or greater, or 1 weapon without the Light property if your STR is 2. If completely unarmed, fists/feet can be considered dual wielded.

Dual wielding different weapons? Roll dice for both weapons and choose either result instead (the 1/round limit still applies). Attacking with advantage? Add an extra die for one of the weapons.

## Unarmed Strikes

To attack with your bare hands or feet, roll 1d4; on hit: deal 1+STR damage.

## Improvised Weapons

Using an improvised weapon (e.g. a chair, a frying pan, a big rock), default to 1d4+STR or 1d6+STR. Your GM may allow you to use bigger dice or other properties if it makes sense. An improvised weapon may be likely to break if it lands a crit, though!

## Customizing Weapons

Can you reflavor a staff as a greatclub? Sure! A sai instead of a dagger? Of course! Could you pay a blacksmith to make your 1d12 Greatmaul deal 2d6 or 3d4 damage instead? Since the dice all add up to 12, it won't break the game; ask your GM! Can a blacksmith make your Dagger deal that much damage? No, sorry!

## Healing Potions

Healing potions are deep, shimmering red elixirs with a refreshing, effervescent taste. These potions are crucial for quick recovery, though their availability is limited. Small towns may have only a few, while cities offer more (but they are not in unlimited supply). The wealthy often use healing potions as a display of affluence, incorporating them into elaborate mixed drinks at social events to showcase their status.

Potions require one action to drink or to administer to an adjacent willing creature.

## Torches & Lanterns

Heroes cannot typically see in the dark. Fighting in the dark imposes the Blinded condition. Heroes can bring a lantern or torch to light their way in the dark as long as they have a hand free (or some other way) to hold it. A torch typically lasts for 1 dungeon (or 1 level of a very large one). A lamp with oil can typically last for 1 entire outing, until your next Safe Rest. Torches and lanterns cast  light up to 6 spaces away; beyond this is darkness.

Be Warned. Denizens of the dark may not appreciate the light and may attack the light bearers first. Certain spells (e.g., Fire, Lightning, and Radiant) may cause flashes of light as well and draw unwanted attention!

## Equipment Availability

Costs for mundane items typically range from a few silver pieces to a few gold pieces. If you can find an artisan, you can commission them to create something for you-basically anything you can think of that their level of technology could support. The more ornate, the higher the price. Commissioning the creation of a special item will typically start around 50 gp and only go up from there. Smaller towns will have fewer items and artisans than larger cities.

## Misc Adventuring Equipment

What About…? These are not all of the items available for purchase, merely a sampling. If you can think of it, you can likely buy it!

## Currency is made up of Silver (sp) and Gold pieces (gp)

10 silver = 1 gold. 1 sp is roughly the cost of a humble meal; 1 gp, a sumptuous feast. Most small towns will have equipment and items worth 50 gp or less. You'll need to adventure  to  larger  towns or cities or find a traveling merchant to purchase more valuable pieces of equipment.

WEAPON OF MANY HANDS

## Magical Items

Though some magical items can be purchased, most cannot. Some special shops may have a very small selection of them to purchase, but more typically these powerful items are acquired through adventuring.

(Rarity varies)

## Weapon of Many Hands

While equipped, this weapon grants the wearer additional arms. The wearer can use the extra arms to perform any task their normal hands can do (wield equipment, Grapple enemies, climb, etc.) but does not allow the wearer to perform actions any faster. These extra appendages may be horrifying to people in polite society. A weapon that grants 1 extra hand is likely to be uncommon; 4 extra hands, legendary.

Extra Arms?! Yes, you can dual wield 2-handed weapons or wear more than 1 shield, or Grapple 2 different creatures while hitting them both at the same time! Or any number of creative things, provided you have the arms to perform the task.

## Harbinger & Sovereign, Abyssal's Claim (Legendary Glaives)

Set of 2 matching glaives, +4 extra arms while both are equipped.

## Weapon of Animosity

Whenever you attack with this weapon, roll an additional animosity die. The weapon deals that much additional damage to your target on a hit. Whenever this weapon misses, you take that damage instead. A weapon that adds 1d4 is likely to be uncommon; 1d10 or greater, legendary.

## Weapon of Slaying

Whenever you attack with this weapon, it deals an additional die of damage against a particular creature type. Those creatures may try to kill you first. A 1d4 weapon of slaying is likely to be uncommon; +1d10 or more, legendary.

## Gnatbane Weapon (Uncommon)

Does not miss Small or Tiny creatures (they may hate you for it and attack you first).

## Weapon of Wounding (Uncommon)

When you land a hit with this weapon, you may suffer 1d6 damage to deal twice that much additional damage to your target.

(Rare)

## Trinket of Ill Omen

While equipped, you have -1 to saves you roll and +1 to your save DC.

(Rare)

## Mindlink Daggers

A matched pair of slender, silver daggers with intertwining runes. Enables the sharing of thoughts between any who holds (or is stabbed by) one.

## Bloodstained Quill (Uncommon)

If you dip this quill into the blood of a dead intelligent creature, the quill animates and writes the last words spoken by that creature.

## Eyes of the Street (Uncommon)

A pair of goggles covered in muck that you can't ever clean off completely. While wearing them, you can look at a rat or a pigeon to gain the ability to see and hear through its senses for 10 minutes. Once you use this ability, you must whisper a secret to the goggles before you can use them again. That secret always seems to become a local rumor before too long….

(Rare)

## Handwraps of Force

While wearing these wraps, whenever you make an unarmed strike, you may push your target up to 2 spaces and yourself the same distance in the opposite direction. You may instead make an attack with no target, striking the air to propel yourself 4 spaces in any direction.

## Resolute Fangs, Golden Bastion

(Legendary Shield)

+8 Armor. Reaction: When you reduce damage from a melee attack with this shield, it may Grapple the attacker regardless of its size (escape DC 20 STR, max 1 creature). Action: Speak this shield's command word to make it immovable, fixed in place, until it is spoken again.

## Key of Doors (Very Rare)

Insert this key into any locked door to open it, not to the room beyond, but to any doorway you've previously walked through while holding this item.

## Grim Coronet (Rare)

When you would die while wearing this crown, gain 3 actions and take a turn immediately. You die at the end of your turn.

## Vindication (Legendary Weapon of Animosity)

A jagged blade marred by scorch marks and dark stains, radiating a bitter, vengeful energy that punishes both wielder and foe alike. +1d12 damage. You take this damage on a miss.

## Pocket Cauldron (Rare)

While Safe Resting, use this to brew your choice of 1 potion, to be consumed immediately:

- Elixir of Futuresight: This potion grants the drinker a brief, cryptic vision of a future event.
- Elixir  of  Requiem: This  potion  allows  the drinker to relive a crucial memory from their past.
- Elixir of Time: Once every 100 years, the cauldron can brew a potion that can take the drinker back in time 1 day.

## Phoenix Helm (Legendary)

If you die while wearing this golden helm, your body explodes in flames and hot ash. You rise anew from the ashes... (see pg. 19 of the GM's Guide for more).

## Ball of Spiders (Uncommon)

A black, palm-sized ball with faintly writhing patterns etched into its surface. Action: Throw this ball up to 6 spaces. Upon impact, it shatters, releasing a swarm of harmless but horrifyingly realistic spectral spiders that cover a 2x2 area. Creatures in the area must make a WIL save or be Frightened until the end of their next turn. Once used, the ball reforms at the next Safe Rest.

## Skitter Shoes (Rare)

While wearing these shoes, you can walk on vertical surfaces or ceilings as if they were flat ground, but only at half your normal Speed. If you end your turn upside down or on a vertical surface, you must make a DC 10 STR save or fall down, landing prone.

## Button of Protection (Rare)

A small, unassuming button etched with a faintly glowing sigil. When sewn onto an outfit, as a reaction when you are attacked, you may pull the button off and throw it into the air. The button emits a sudden, dazzling flash of light and a high-pitched whistle. The attacker must make a WIL save or be distracted, causing the attack to miss you.

After use, the button becomes inert. It can be sewn back onto a garment during a Safe Rest by an experienced seamstress or tailor with silver thread, which reactivates its power.

## Spell Scrolls & Wands

## Spell Scrolls

Spell scrolls are single-use inscribed magical spells. Casting a spell with a spell scroll does not cost mana, nor does it require magical ability. Anyone who can read the language the scroll is written in can utilize it. Reading one aloud takes the same number of actions the spell normally takes and consumes the scroll.

A character must succeed on a DC 10 Arcana check to cast it successfully if they do not already know a spell from that school; on a failure, it is wasted. Spell tier and typical price:

| SPELLTIER   | COST    | SPELLTIER   | COST       |
|-------------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Cantrip     | 10gp    | Tier 5Spell | 3,000gp    |
| Tier 1Spell | 35gp    | Tier 6Spell | 10,000gp   |
| Tier 2Spell | 100gp   | Tier 7Spell | 25,000+gp  |
| Tier 3Spell | 300gp   | Tier 8Spell | 75,000+gp  |
| Tier 4Spell | 1,000gp | Tier 9Spell | 200,000+gp |

## Wands

Like spell scrolls, these can be used to cast spells without consuming mana and do not require magical ability. Unlike spell scrolls, wands can be recharged and used again. Characters proficient with wands can use one from any spell school, spending only the normal amount of actions to cast the spell.

Characters not proficient with wands must succeed on a DC 10+spell tier Arcana check to successfully cast the spell. Success or failure, the charge is spent. Typical wand prices and examples:

| SPELLTIER   | COST    | SPELLTIER   | COST         |
|-------------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Cantrip     | 50gp    | Tier 5Spell | 15,000gp     |
| Tier 1Spell | 175gp   | Tier 6Spell | 50,000gp     |
| Tier 2Spell | 500gp   | Tier 7Spell | 125,000+gp   |
| Tier 3Spell | 1,500gp | Tier 8Spell | 375,000+gp   |
| Tier 4Spell | 5,000gp | Tier 9Spell | 1,000,000+gp |

## Wand of Firestep

SPELLS

ARTIST: ALEXANDRA PETRUK

## Spells

There are 6 main schools of magic. Each school has its own basic spells called cantrips and 9 tiers of progressively more powerful spells that can be unlocked as heroes level up. Heroes can cast any spell from the schools that they know within the tiers they have unlocked.

Mana. Powerful tiered spells require mana-a portion of the spellcaster's life force-to fuel them. A spell's mana cost is equal to its tier. See the Heroes book for more info on how different classes gain mana. Cantrips, cost no mana.

Upcasting. You can spend additional mana on tiered spells (up to the tier that you have unlocked) to make them stronger for each additional mana spent.

Multi-Target/Area of Effect (AoE). Multi-target/AoE attacks follow special rules to streamline play: they do not miss or crit, and a single roll is applied to all targets. (Ignore (dis)advantage from conditions on individual targets-such as Blinded or Grappled-though anything granting you (dis)advantage still applies to your roll as normal.)

Save Spells. A hero's save DC is typically 10+KEY.

Range and Reach. Just like weapons, spells with 'Range' can target creatures from a distance, but are cast with disadvantage if any enemy is adjacent to you. Add 1 die of disadvantage to gain +2 Range (max +6). Spells with 'Reach' can't do this, but they are cast as normal even when in melee.

- Fire Spells. Deal high, consistent damage at medium range. Some fire spells can inflict the Smoldering condition and gain additional destructive effects against Smoldering enemies.
- Ice Spells. Deal medium damage at long range, with a focus on controlling the battlefield and protecting the spellcaster. Some ice spells have additional effects against Hampered targets.
- Lightning Spells. Deal high damage at long range with a focus on teleporting around the battlefield and taking advantage of creatures equipped with metal. However, some lightning spells may fail to find ground and damage the spellcaster instead.
- Necrotic Spells. Summon horrible minions or manipulate and trap targets. Some risky necrotic spells prey upon damaged creatures, sapping their very life force-but frequently fail to distinguish between friend and foe.
- Radiant Spells. Can obliterate the unholy, the fearful, and those who would dare harm you or your allies. Equally effective at a distance or in melee. Other spells can protect, mend wounds, and even restore creatures back to life!
- Wind Spells. Aid in moving friend and foe alike around the battlefield. They can also slice and cut through entire groups of foes and viciously deal extra damage on critical hits.

Secret Spells. Some spells have been hidden or lost through the ages. Whether they are too dangerous to be common knowledge or for other reasons, adventurers can sometimes stumble upon new spells (or wrench them out of the undead hands of a defeated Lich).

## Optional Variant Rules

If your playgroup likes extra little tactical nuggets, your GM can allow you to try out some of these additional variants to add some more spice to your game. You can always try out a rule for 1 session and see how you all like it before committing to it.

- Multiclassing. If  your GM wants to allow for additional creativity for experienced players (and potentially broken combos!), when heroes level up, they may choose any class. For example, when a level 4 Berserker levels up, he could pick Commander, and take the level 1 Commander features instead of the level 5 Berserker features. He would have 4 d12 hit dice and a single d10 hit die. A hero gains all the equipment proficiencies of all their classes but should use the advantaged/disadvantaged saves of whichever class has the highest level.
- 'Broken' Can Be Fun! Planning, building, optimizing, and 'breaking' a class build IS the fun for many people. The GM may need to make the game substantially more challenging if multiclassing is allowed. The GM also may veto any particularly overpowered, unfun, or implausible combo for the sake of the story and overall fun of the table. If this happens, well done! Your hero was too powerful for reality.
- Small Groups. A GM and a single hero can play with the aid of a sidekick. Sidekicks are NPCs that the hero's player controls during combat and the GM controls outside of combat. Sidekicks get 2 actions and are always 1 level below the hero character. If the main hero dies, the sidekick can be upgraded 1 level, and hire his own sidekick to keep the adventure going! A GM can optionally allow one or two sidekicks with a party of 2-3 heroes as well.
- Large Groups. 3rd party adventures are typically balanced for parties of 3-5 players. Playing with very large groups (6-10+ heroes) can be made far more manageable simply by limiting each hero's actions to 2 instead of 3. No other rebalancing needs to be done.
- Fast Resting. For a much more heroic and fastpaced story, a Safe Rest can heal all Wounds.
- Critical Healing. Treat healing just like an attack roll. Rolling the max is a crit (rolling again just like an attack crit), rolling 1 is a failure to heal (note: this variant is FUN for the right group that enjoys big, dramatic, swingy moments). Consider increment the die size by one step if you use this variant (d4 » d6 » d8 » d10 » d12).
- I Had the High Ground. Taking a crit while at a
- height may cause a character to fall down. A reasonable STR save may be called for, but a weak character (e.g., a kobold) may just fall automatically.
- Thrown Potions. Treat  potions  like  Ranged attacks (Range 8). The potion misses on a 1; otherwise it heals for half as much since some splashes away and is wasted.
- Sucker Punch. A character standing up from Prone gives adjacent  enemies the chance to take opportunity attacks (heroes and monsters alike).
- Playing Dead. Whenever a Hero drops to 0 HP, they can attempt to play dead by falling prone and making an Influence check (or other skill check as the situation demands).
- Inspiration. Whenever a hero does something memorable (role-plays a great moment, makes everyone laugh, miss an attack multiple times in a row, or otherwise engages in desired behavior), the GM can grant Inspiration: the ability to reroll any single die. Inspiration expires after a Safe Rest.
- Retreat. The world is dangerous, and some fights may be unwinnable. Any hero may call for a retreat on their turn. If the party agrees-unless there is a good reason story-wise that a party can't escape (e.g., they are trapped in nets and completely surrounded by a band of nasty kobolds)-the GM allows them to flee. Each hero describes their escape (e.g., casting a spell, using equipment, or making a skill check). Consequences may follow, such as taking damage, suffering a Wound, or failing a quest. If the escape is particularly clever, the GM may allow the party to escape without additional consequence. After all, the shame of retreating is often punishment enough!
- Different Key Stats. Players can swap KEY or Secondary stats for a class if it makes sense (e.g., DEX and WIL for the Cheat).
- Complex Characters. A GM may allow heroes to pick 2 backgrounds and/or ancestry bonuses.
- Custom Weapon Dice. For larger weapon die sizes, you can try using dice of a different size as long as they add up to the same initial die size. For example: a 1d10 glaive could be 1d4+1d6 or 1d6+1d4 (using the first die as the primary die).

## Measuring Spaces

Generally, speed is preferred above precision while playing a TTRPG-don't make other people wait unnecessarily, close enough is good enough! However, if your table prefers precise rulings rather than fast but 'good enough' ones, use the options below as a reference.

## Diagonal Spaces

Treating diagonal spaces as adjacent is the default assumption, as it tends to be easier and faster (though it can cause some spatial 'weirdness' that some may not prefer). Instead, you can treat diagonals as not adjacent at all or count every other diagonal as adjacent (fiddly, but a good balance).

It's up to your table, but whatever the heroes can do (moving or attacking diagonally), monsters can do as well.

## Cones & Lines

For a cone, start at the character and extend X spaces outward. The cone can be up to X spaces wide at the farthest edge (you can make it narrower than X, but not wider).

For a line, starting from the character, extend the area up to X spaces in a single direction (you can make it shorter, but not longer), and 1 space wide. If a space is at least halfway covered by the cone or line, it is included in the effect.

Advantage X. Roll X additional dice and drop the X lowest dice (removing dice from the left to right in the case of a tie).

Ally. A friendly creature, not yourself.

Assess. An action to strategically analyze the situation  in combat, see pg. 14.

Attack. Any offensive action. Swinging with a weapon, casting a harmful spell, Grappling, etc.

Blindsight X. You can sense creatures and obstacles normally within X spaces, ignoring Blinded, darkness, and invisibility.
