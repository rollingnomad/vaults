BERSERKER

<!-- image -->

Wrath and Ruin. The Berserker is destruction. He knows not fatigue nor caution-both surely driven away from him in a relentless fury. Those of barbaric nature are said to eat only the dust of war and drink naught but the blood of those felled by their own hand.

Death is no stranger, for it is said that even death fears to take a Berserker before his battle Rage is satiated. Once a Berserker has begun to fight, he only grows stronger, fueled by battle-lust and an unending Rage. The deadliest among them is not the wellrested, but those who are pushed to the brink through combat. It matters not what a Berserker takes up, be it axe or sword; flesh will be hewn from bone and heads from shoulders. Many have caved under the Berserker's primal might-sword and spell are but straw in the wake of unbridled Rage. As a Berserker, you can:

- Become a raging, damage-dealing machine. Greet death as an old friend and keep on fighting!
- Increase your damage to unbelievable levels. The longer a fight goes on, the more your Rage intensifies, allowing you to deal out incredible amounts of brutality.
- Use your Savage Arsenal. Choose abilities to crush your foes and laugh in the face of death!

## THE CHEAT

<!-- image -->

Cloak and dagger… and dagger. The common Cheat doesn't call herself a Cheat, of course-rather, a streetsmart rogue, a survivalist, or a liberator of unused goods. They are masters of stealth, pickpocketing, and smooth talking. Some of the more vicious ilk are masters of death-dealing as well.

Cheats can be found in every city and byway under countless different names, but they all believe something similar: It's a cruel, merciless world, and those who aim to survive don't have time for silly things like 'morals' or 'honor.' Those are luxuries of the rich and powerful. Honor gets you killed-survival is about taking what you want, when you can. As The Cheat, you can:

- Break the rules! You can change the dice you roll to whatever numbers suit you best!
- Sneak in and backstab enemies with devastating critical hits, taking down even huge, heavily-armored foes with a single blow!
- Fight dirty with pocket sand, low blows, and vicious blades. When things get out of hand, disappear into the night, and live to cheat another day!

- You may gain advantage on skill checks while playing any games, competitions, or placing wagers. If you're caught though…

HUNTER

<!-- image -->

R espect the forest and her children, and she will bestow upon you many gifts. Long before the first stones of the grand kingdoms had been laid, there was The Wild . We Hunters called groves and fields home, just as the elk and boar still do. We have trained our minds and hearts as much as we have trained with bows.

For, there is great danger in becoming a Hunter: the intoxicating Thrill of the Hunt that washes over your body when stalking prey. Be warned-do not allow it to settle into your heart. For no true Hunter takes without recognizing what they have first been given: a soul, a meal… warmth, all at a cost-a life. And that should not be taken lightly. Wherever you roam, be it city or glade, mountain or valley, as long as The Wild is tenderly tucked into the depths of your heart, you will always be a Hunter. May your arrows strike true and your bowstrings never break.

## Hunters are:

- Relentless Trackers. As an expert survivalist, you mark your prey, becoming a shadow in pursuit, relentless and precise.
- Masters of the Wild. Harness the Thrill of the Hunt to outwit your targets-set decoys, spring traps, and strike with lethal efficiency.
- Deadly from Afar or Up Close. Whether you're raining arrows from a distance or closing in for a personal takedown, your prey won't escape your reach.

MAGE

<!-- image -->

Elemental power flows through all things… find it, study it, and harness it. A mage is bestowed their first strand of the Tapestry at birth; however, true mastery eludes those who idly rest upon this innate endowment. Instead, they diligently refine their natural gifts through scholarly pursuit, with tomes and parchments as their companions, alongside the sage counsel of a seasoned mentor or three! Yes, this is the chosen path of those who would wield authority over the elements.

Comprehending the tapestry of mana is no trivial endeavor-it will yield its arcane secrets only to the earnest seeker of knowledge. Yet, once the adept learns to discern the subtleties of its intricate patterns as it unfurls and meanders into the ethereal expanse-it is in that moment the apprentice truly ascends to the mantle of mage. What makes a Mage:

- Spellshaper. Customize the spells you cast: stretch time, gain extra-dimensional vision, or echo cast multiple spells!
- Elemental Mastery. Harness the power of the elements, whether raining down fire from the heavens, freezing enemies in their tracks, or striking with thunderous bolts of lightning.
- Chaos or Control. Will you snatch control of the frayed tapestry of mana or lean into the forces of chaos? What awaits you… Diamond Skin? Elemental Entanglement? Liquefy Legs?

SHADOWMANCER

<!-- image -->

T otally NOT evil. Why would you even say that? Great power sometimes comes from… horrible places. But what's the alternative, spend our entire lives… STUDYING?! Now that's horrible. Who'd want to waste their lives reading books -learning magic the hard way? Work SMART, not hard. Just scheme up a way to take what you need from someone who won't miss it-ancient horrors don't guard their power nearly as well as you'd think! And if there's power just laying around, it'd be dumb of me to not use it, really.

So what if I wear black and have to occasionally sacrifice an animal here and there while chanting? Does that automatically mean I'm evil? *Pfft,* hardly! Not every ANCIENT HORROR is the same; that's like saying crow black and spider black are the same. Okay, bad examples, but the point stands. If you're tired of swinging swords around and getting sweaty like a peasant, just summon a horde of shadow minions to do your bidding. They're always eager to serve! As a Shadowmancer:

- Unspeakable Power Awaits. Use your cunning to forge pacts with ancient, unfathomable entities, drawing upon their incomprehensible power to crush foes and bend the shadows to your will.
- Master Shadow Minions. Summon legions of shadowy minions to overwhelm your adversaries and bolster your magical abilities. Let them swarm your foes, serving as both sword and fodder in your quest for dominance.

SHEPHERD

<!-- image -->

L et all who are afflicted come. I will mend thy bones and soothe thy wounds. Thou shalt revere the gifts of life and death, neither of which is ever given or taken. Rather, we are all souls merely journeying between this realm and that of the beyond. But alas, often do these wandering souls find themselves bereft of guidance. Thus falls upon the Shepherd the solemn duty-to be a beacon of light to those ensnared in darkness, and darkness to those who, in hubris, deem themselves to be the light.

For many, the journey of service is a difficult path-yet, in this task we are not solitary. Our Lifebinding Spirits, the steadfast companions of our faith, are bound beside us, comforting and aiding us in the stewardship we've been given. As a Shepherd, you:

- Embrace the Balance. Embody the forces of Life and Death, wielding spells from your chosen domains. As you walk the path of balance, ponder which way the scales shall tip: towards healing or harm?
- Lead a Faithful Companion. Summon a Lifebinding spirit to your side, providing invaluable support in battle. Whether bolstering allies with healing or smiting foes with righteous fury, your spirit companion stands ready to aid in the struggle.

SONGWEAVER

<!-- image -->

J ust TRY and resist my charm… wait-NO, don't! Each Songweaver holds a spark granted to them by a muse at birth; a spark which fuels their creative energy and flows forth in the form of a sharp wit, relentless humor, or moving art.

The power of a Songweaver's spark is also evident in their powerful sway over others. Songweavers can bolster and infuse courage in their allies, or… make their enemies' brains leak out through their ears. The Songweaver can bring a whole new meaning to verbal abuse! They can even redirect the (often justified) attacks of others, in order to protect their own moneymakers. As a Songweaver, you can:

- Charm the hapless people you meet and inspire your allies to reach fantastic new heights of heroism!
- Use your Lyrical Weaponry and powerful charisma to dominate enemies and call special friends to aid you in your journeys and battles. You can even redirect attacks away from yourself and make enemies attack their own allies!
- Control the Battlefield with a chord of chaos, a rad heroic ballad, or a debilitating rhapsody; make your allies and enemies alike dance to your tune!

(advantage if you ask him to do something he would find mischievous or fun; with disadvantage if it is something he would find good or menial).

Gran Gran (NOT a hag). When resting, you may summon her for 1 hour to soothe your wounds (and hassle you for not eating enough). She bakes and hands out pastries equal to your WIL+INT. Eating one recovers one mana, Hit Die, or Wound. Eat them while they're warm! They expire in 10 minutes.

Feel free to work with your GM to make it happen. As long as the mechanics stay roughly the same, have fun!

- LEVEL 11 Fire in my Bones. Your Songweaver's Inspiration also grants your target 1 additional action.
- LEVEL 15 Chorus of Champions. (1/encounter) Free Reaction: Give all party members 1 action.

Making Your Own People. You can work with your GM to swap out Stompy, Gran Gran, Mal, and Linos for your own creations if you like. 1 in-combat person whose damage scales with your level (see other spells and abilities for appropriate amounts of damage or other effects), 1 out-of-combat support person, 1 who can help in narrative situations, and 1 who can give sporadic utility. Follow that broad pattern and you'll be fine!

If you find yourself never wanting to use one, make it slightly stronger; if you're using it too frequently, consider bringing the power level down slightly or adding some other drawback.

STORMSHIFTER

<!-- image -->

T he trees whisper their excitement, the clouds sing with glee. Rejoice! The Master of Storm and Fang arrives. All who would seek passage through the ancient grove, heed this warning: Do not provoke the forest or its inhabitants. Beseech for passage humbly, even if its guardian is unseen, rest assured that you … are not.

Those who traverse the woodlands may feel the vigilant gaze of a Stormshifter upon them. Legend speaks of an ancient union between mortal and dryad, birthing beings capable of wielding lightning and tempests as others wield blade and shield. This is but half the tale.

Wanderers recount encounters with beings, some wise and benevolent, others fearsome, with claws that sparked with lightning and pelts sharp as daggers. They are as one with storm and beast, embodying the serene beauty and raw power of nature's grace. As a Stormshifter, you can:

- Aid your allies in whatever role is most needed.
- Wade into the fray as a shapeshifted beast ranging from friendly to vicious, indomitable, or HORRIBLE.
- Cast powerful spells from a distance to strike down, control, mend, and more.

ZEPHYR

<!-- image -->

A Zephyr dedicates their life to the relentless pursuit of kinetic perfection. They hone their bodies into blurs of motion, training from a young age in remote wilds or mountain monasteries, wielding speed to unleash blows that echo through their foes and slip past attacks like a whispering wind. Speed is both their weapon and shield.

Through ceaseless training, they harness their inner momentum to achieve feats of supernatural agility, executing every motion with flowing precision. The Zephyr is:

-  Unarmed and Dangerous. When unarmed and unarmored, you're a relentless force on the battlefield. Absorb blows and deliver devastating strikes, leaving foes in awe of your tenacity and speed.
-  A Graceful Combatant. Move with unparalleled speed and determination, outpacing your allies and foes alike. Seize the initiative and strike swiftly, ensuring you're always at the forefront of combat. Your reflexes allow you to retaliate with precision and turn enemy strikes into opportunities for devastating counterattacks.

## STORY-BASED SUBCLASSES

Sometimes the story you play takes a dramatic turn: all but one party member dies, your Patron betrays you, you save the life of a beast that now refuses to leave your side…

These moments may call for an equally dramatic shift in the class you're playing, thus the story-based subclasses. Generally, these are not appropriate to pick at level 1. At your GM's discretion, these can be chosen at any point in a campaign when a story demands it, replacing your existing subclass.

These classes may be a bit more mechanically involved and better suited for more experienced players, but these subclasses are NOT more powerful than others, just different.

<!-- image -->

Dark Benediction. Fallen from the light, but not entirely. You lose access to the following Radiant spells: True Strike, Heal, and Warding Bond; and gain access to the following Necrotic spells: Entice, Shadowtrap, and Dread Visage.

Paragon of Power. (Replaces Paragon of Virtue) Advantage on Might checks when attempting to intimidate others.

<!-- image -->

## SPELLBLADE

-- STEEL MEETS SPELL --

Arcane Command. Your focus on the arcane causes you to lose access to Weapon Mastery and Combat Tactics, but you now gain INT mana when you roll Initiative (this mana is lost if unspent when combat ends). Whenever you could choose a Combat Tactic or Weapon Mastery, instead choose another Commander's Order or a tier 1 (or lower) spell from any spell school. Your Commander's Orders are also empowered with magical power:

BEASTMASTER

<!-- image -->

## BEASTMASTER

-- TOGETHER, UNSTOPPABLE --

Beastmaster. Choose a Small, Medium, or Large animal as your companion. Instead of your first 2 Thrill of the Hunt (TotH) abilities, you can select Go for the Throat! and Protect Me! to use with your companion.

No Stats or Actions to Track! Your companion's HP and movement are abstracted; it knows where it is most needed without being told-whether defending you or attacking your quarry. It is smart enough, and you are caring enough, to make sure it is never put in mortal danger.

Extra Abilities? At the GM's discretion, your companion can also do anything the base animal can do: fly, sniff out scents, be used as a mount, etc. Even more complex actions like Grapple or Help may be doable if it makes sense (you'll need to spend 1 action to command it though-it isn't smart enough to do so on its own).

- Keen Eyes. (1/encounter) Mark a target for free . Level 7. 2/encounter. Level 11. 3/encounter.

- Go for the Throat! (1/encounter) Costs 1 TotH charge: Your companion attacks your quarry for 1d4+LVL damage for free (ignoring armor). Level 11. 2/encounter, 1/round. Level 15. 3/encounter, 1/round.

## MEDIUM COMPANION (Wolf, Boar, Panther, Vulture, Giant Spider, etc.) Req. Level 3.

- Ferocious. Whenever you or your companion crit your quarry, your companion attacks again for LVL damage (ignoring armor), and you can move up to 2 spaces for free. Level 7. 4 spaces. Level 15. 6 spaces.
- Protect me! When you Defend, your companion may first attack that creature for 1d4+LVL damage.
- Go for the Throat! (1/encounter) Costs 1 TotH charge, action: Your companion attacks your quarry, for 1d8+(3×LVL) damage (ignoring armor). Level 11. 2/encounter.

## LARGE COMPANION (Lion, Owlbear, Elk, Giant Scorpion, Drake, etc.) Req. Level 3.

- Alpha Protector. Damage from the first attack against you each round is halved.
- Protect me! (1/encounter) After you gain a Wound, your companion can whisk you away to safety up to 12 spaces. Level 7. You are whisked away before gaining the Wound. Level 15. 2/encounter.
- Go for the Throat! (1/encounter) Costs 2 TotH charges, 2 actions: Your companion attacks your quarry for 1d12+(4×LVL) damage (ignoring armor). If that creature dies, you may deal half as much to another creature within Reach 4. Level 11. 2/encounter.

Note. Your companion's attacks count as your own for gaining TotH charges. Abilities that spend TotH charges cannot miss nor can they generate new charges. Unused charges are lost when combat ends.
