| Type | Rest | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Field | Catch Breath | Requires at least 10 minutes to tend to your injuries. Expend any number of Hit Dice one at a time (roll them and add your STR to each), and regain that many HP. |
| Field | Make Camp | If you rest for at least 8 hours with food and sleep, take the maximum value for each Hit Die you expend instead of rolling. Add your STR to each Hit Die as usual. |
| Safe | Safe Rest | After a Safe Rest, heroes recover all of their HP, Hit Dice, mana (and other class-specific resources), and heal 1 Wound. Safe Rests are a great opportunity for downtime activities as well. |

## Field Rests

While out adventuring, heroes can take Field Rests to regain HP.

> What if I Have Negative STR? Your frail body doesn't recover as quickly as others. Subtract your STR from each HD you expend.

## Safe Rests

Safe Rests take place in a safe location designated by your GM, typically lodging at an inn overnightbut could also be at a secret oasis, a well-stocked cabin in the woods, near a sacred shrine, or the like. Camping in the open wilderness or in a dungeon is not sufficient for gaining the benefits of a Safe Rest.

> Rest for HOW Long? ! If your table prefers to largely skip downtime activities and narrate past a week of resting, that's okay too! For a more realistic convalescence time, 1 week per wound recovered may make more sense.

## Lodging

The cheapest rooms at an inn save you money but may lead to complications. On the other hand, some inns may allow you to pay a premium for a nicer room and amenities, giving you a Temporary Boon. Typical prices (each person/day): Poor (5 sp), Comfortable (2 gp), and Lavish (10 gp). Lavish inns allow players to gain one Temporary Boon the following day (see Lodging Boons table on pg. 22 of the GM's Guide ).

## Downtime

The  time  you  aren't  out  adventuring  is  called Downtime . You can spend Downtime to recuperate from your adventures and partake in Downtime Activities. Not every moment of Downtime needs to be narrated or roleplayed. Much Downtime can be skipped over to get back to adventuring if desired. Example Downtime Activities:


| Activity | Effect|
|:---:|---|
| Retrain | Spend time doing activities to retrain any of your chosen abilities, features, or if it makes sense in the story, possibly even your subclass.|
| Gather Information  | NPCs, pick up news, or collect rumors and job leads.|
| Personal Goals | Pursue goals from your backstory or other smaller quests you've chosen.|
| Buy & Sell | Get new equipment, and sell treasures you've collected while out adventuring.|
| Perform | Play music, tell stories, compete, or perform in public to earn gold or fame.|
| Craft  |Create weapons, armor, or simple items using materials you've acquired.|
| Socialize  |Build alliances, make new friends, or make new enemies.|
| Invest | Use your gold to invest in businesses or trade ventures for future profit.|
| Mentor  |Teach a skill or ability to another character or NPC.|
| Research | Investigate a mystery, study ancient texts, or uncover hidden knowledge.|
| Serve | Aid a patron or a deity in exchange for a favor, or perform charity for townsfolk.|
| Build | Establish a home base, start a business, craft siege weapons, or build anything else you can imagine (GM and setting-permitting, of course).|
