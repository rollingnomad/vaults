There are 6 main schools of magic. Each school has its own basic spells called cantrips and 9 tiers of progressively more powerful spells that can be unlocked as heroes level up. Heroes can cast any spell from the schools that they know within the tiers they have unlocked.

- Mana 
    * Powerful tiered spells require mana-a portion of the spellcaster's life force-to fuel them. A spell's mana cost is equal to its tier. See the Heroes book for more info on how different classes gain mana. Cantrips, cost no mana.

- Upcasting 
    * You can spend additional mana on tiered spells (up to the tier that you have unlocked) to make them stronger for each additional mana spent.

- Multi-Target/Area of Effect (AoE) 

    * Multi-target/AoE attacks follow special rules to streamline play: they do not miss or crit, and a single roll is applied to all targets. (Ignore (dis)advantage from conditions on individual targets-such as Blinded or Grappled-though anything granting you (dis)advantage still applies to your roll as normal.)

- Save Spells 
    * A hero's save DC is typically 10+KEY.

- Range and Reach
    * Just like weapons, spells with 'Range' can target creatures from a distance, but are cast with disadvantage if any enemy is adjacent to you. Add 1 die of disadvantage to gain +2 Range (max +6). Spells with 'Reach' can't do this, but they are cast as normal even when in melee.

| School | Description |
|---|---|
| Fire Spells | Deal high, consistent damage at medium range. Some fire spells can inflict the Smoldering condition and gain additional destructive effects against Smoldering enemies.|
| Ice Spells | Deal medium damage at long range, with a focus on controlling the battlefield and protecting the spellcaster. Some ice spells have additional effects against Hampered targets.|
| Lightning Spells | Deal high damage at long range with a focus on teleporting around the battlefield and taking advantage of creatures equipped with metal. However, some lightning spells may fail to find ground and damage the spellcaster instead.|
| Necrotic Spells | Summon horrible minions or manipulate and trap targets. Some risky necrotic spells prey upon damaged creatures, sapping their very life force; but frequently fail to distinguish between friend and foe.|
| Radiant Spells | Can obliterate the unholy, the fearful, and those who would dare harm you or your allies. Equally effective at a distance or in melee. Other spells can protect, mend wounds, and even restore creatures back to life!|
| Wind Spells | Aid in moving friend and foe alike around the battlefield. They can also slice and cut through entire groups of foes and viciously deal extra damage on critical hits.|

> Secret Spells. Some spells have been hidden or lost through the ages. Whether they are too dangerous to be common knowledge or for other reasons, adventurers can sometimes stumble upon new spells (or wrench them out of the undead hands of a defeated Lich).
