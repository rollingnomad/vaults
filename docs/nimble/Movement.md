## Move Action

A character can move up to their speed (6 spaces, unless otherwise noted). This  movement can be broken up with other actions if desired, and a hero can use multiple actions to Move multiple times in one turn. When in Difficult Terrain , movement speed is halved. Moving on a climbable surface (trees, a cliffside, certain buildings, etc.) counts as Difficult Terrain.

## Speed & Range

A character's Speed is how fast they can move, which, unless otherwise noted, is 6 . Often play is done on a grid with 1 inch squares or hexagons representing roughly 5 ft. or 1 meter each. So a hero with a speed of 6 can travel up to 6 spaces horizontally or diagonally.

You can move through spaces occupied by allies (or enemies as difficult terrain: half speed), as long as you don't end movement in an occupied space.

Alternate Options. For a quicker, more loose game, you can forego counting spaces and measure typical movement roughly from pinkie to thumb. Slightly less for players

with large hands (or slower characters), a bit more for our tiny-handed friends (or faster characters).

## Range & Reach

Certain abilities, weapons, and spells have a specified Range or Reach, which determines how far away your target can be affected. If none is specified, default to Reach 1.

- In Melee. If any enemy is adjacent to you, your Ranged attacks are made with disadvantage (Reach attacks are not so affected).
- Long Range. You can gain disadvantage 1 to gain +2 Range on any Ranged attack (max +6).

## Falling & Forced Movement

When a character is forcibly moved but stopped by an obstacle, they take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every space this movement is shortened. If they hit another creature, both creatures split this damage. Falling inflicts 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 ft. fallen (2 spaces).

Abstracted Distances. If preferred, you can use a more abstracted system of distance just as well. Use Close , Midrange , and Far . A move from Midrange can traverse to Close or Far. Close creatures can be affected Reach/Range 4; Midrange, up to 6; beyond that is Far. As always, the GM will adjudicate unclear situations and which creatures are affected by abilities with an area of effect.

## Concentration

Some activities require Concentration to maintain. A character can only concentrate on one activity at a time. Whenever a character is crit while concentrating, they must make a DC 10 STR save . Failing this means Concentration is broken and the activity fails. Concentration is automatically broken whenever a character drops to 0 HP or is incapacitated.

## Cover & Hiding

A  creature  mostly  obscured from line of sight (standing behind a tree, a larger ally, a knocked over table, in poor lighting, etc.) has Cover and imposes disadvantage on attacks against them. A creature completely obscured from view has Full Cover and cannot typically be targeted by an attack.

To hide in combat, you must have Cover from the creatures you are attempting to hide from and use an action to make a DC 15 Stealth check (if you have Full Cover, you succeed automatically). The first attack you make while hidden is made with advantage, then you are no longer hidden. If this attack kills the enemy and no other enemy can see you, you may remain hidden instead.

Monsters Are Smart! They may catch on to heroes using the same tactics over and over again!

## Grappling

You can attempt to grab another creature provided you are within Reach and have at least 1 arm free (or some other way to grab them). On a failed STR or DEX save (DC 10+STR or DEX), a target:

- your size or smaller, is Grappled.
- larger than you, you gain the Riding condition.

Forced movement (pushing a grappler away), incapacitation, or spending an action and succeeding on a STR or DEX save can end it.

Restrained. Functions like Grappled, but is caused by objects (e.g., chains, rope, roots) and ignores size restrictions. It can also be ended through any logical means, such as picking a lock or cutting/burning rope.
