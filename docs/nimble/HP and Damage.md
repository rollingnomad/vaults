## Hit Points & Dying

Hit Points (HP) represent your ability to endure damage. Damage reduces your HP (which can't go below 0). When reduced to 0 HP, gain 1 Wound; you also gain the Dying condition until you regain HP. While Dying, actions are limited to 1, Concentration is broken, and you are at risk of further serious harm:

- Attacking/casting spells causes 1 Wound unless you make a DC 10 STR save .
- Taking damage while Dying causes 2 Wounds; a crit causes 3 instead.

## Wounds

Wounds are serious injuries you've taken; they are a long term gauge of how close you are to death. HP can usually be recovered quickly, but Wounds may take many days of resting to fully recover from (usually 1/Safe Rest).

## Death

You die when you have taken 6 Wounds (unless you have an ability that changes this number). There are ways to revive a hero who has died, but they are rare and often come at a very steep cost.

## Temporary HP

Some abilities or effects may grant temporary HP (temp HP); these are reduced first when taking damage. Temp HP do not combine: If a hero has temp HP and would gain more, they instead choose which amount to keep. They expire after a Safe Rest.

## Hit Dice

Hit Dice (HD) represent your ability to quickly recuperate from minor injuries and are spent to regain HP. Heroes start with a max of 1 Hit Die at level 1, and this limit increases by 1 each time they level up. Hit Dice are recovered during a Safe Rest (see 'RESTING & DOWNTIME' on page 17).

Gritty Dying Rules. Optional rules for a more challenging or 'old school' style of game: You can reduce the max number of Wounds heroes have. Anywhere from a max of 5 Wounds for slightly harder, all the way down to 1-2 Wounds for a very lethal game! 00

You can also have each Wound impose a cumulative -1 penalty to rolls: skill checks, saves, or even ALL rolls! (If you're a real glutton for punishment.)

## Monsters & Armor

Most monsters are unarmored, but some tougher foes might have armor:

|Tier|Effect|
|---|---|
| Medium Armor | Mobs take damage from only the dice rolled, ignoring all damage modifiers (unless they are negative). |
| Heavy Armor | Mobs take only half the damage from the dice , likewise ignoring damage modifiers.|

## Minions

Minions are weak enemies that will die from any amount of damage. They move and attack at the same time, cannot crit, and their feeble attacks can be Defended against as if they were a single attack. Dealing a large amount of damage to a minion can (at the GM's discretion) overflow to other minions within range as well.

Crits and damage vulnerabilities ignore monster armor. This means that different heroes and different weapons, spells, and abilities will be more or less effective against various kinds of armor.
