## Making A Hero

Your hero is how you will make your mark on the world. Here's how you can make your own hero:

Step 1: Choose Your Class. This will have the largest impact on the other  character choices you make and how you interact with the world (see the Heroes book for more details):

- BERSERKER. An unstoppable force of wrath and ruin.
- THE CHEAT. Sneaky, backstabbing, dirty-fighting rogue.
- COMMANDER. A battlefield tactician, leader, and weapon master.
- HUNTER. Resourceful survivalist, bow master, and skilled tracker.
- MAGE. Wield and shape the elements of fire, ice, and lightning.
- OATHSWORN. Faithful guardian, protector, and avenger of the weak.
- SHADOWMANCER. Summon hordes of expendable minions.
- SHEPHERD. Master life and death. Lead a faithful companion.
- SONGWEAVER. Inspiring presence, sharp wit, sharper tongue.
- STORMSHIFTER. Master of weather, beast, and nature.
- ZEPHYR. A disciplined martial artist with swift hands and swift feet.

Step 2: Choose Your Ancestry & Background (and optionally, choose your adventuring motivation). What made your hero want to start adventuring? How do you know the other heroes?

Step 3: Fill in Your Character Sheet. This handy sheet of paper helps you track your stats, abilities, loot, and other important game info (see pg. 21).

## The Character Sheet

## 1. Basic Details & Stats

Fill in your character details: Name, Ancestry, Class, Level, Height, and Weight. Fill in the arrow for your advantaged (+) and disadvantaged (-) Saves, and choose a stat array (recommended: place the highest numbers in the KEY stats for your class).

| Array | Stats |
|---|---|
| Standard | +2, +2, +0, -1 |
| Balanced | +2, +1, +1, +0 |
| Min-Max | +3, +1, -1, -1 |

> Example. The Cheat has DEX and INT as their KEY stats. With the Min-Max array, you might put +3 in DEX, +1 in INT, and -1 in WIL and STR. You'd also mark ▲ for DEX saves and ▼ for WIL saves.

## 2. Skill Points

At level 1, mark your stat bonuses into each of your respective skills (e.g., a hero with +2 DEX would mark +2 in Finesse and Stealth), and then may place 4 additional skill points wherever you like.

> Example. If you have -1 INT; mark -1 for Arcana, Examination, and Lore. Repeat for your other stats. Then, with your 4 extra points, you could increase Stealth and Finesse by +2 each; any 4 skills by 1 each; or dump all 4 points into your favorite single skill. Up to you!

## 3. Secondary Stats

Mark your:


- Max HP
- Hit Dice size (see your class)
- Hit Die amount (default: equal to your level)
- Initiative (default: DEX)
- Size
- Speed (default: 6)
- Max Wounds (default: 6)
- Inventory slots (10+STR)


## 4. Equipment & Money

Heroes start at level 1 with the equipment listed for their class and background OR 50 gp to buy their starting equipment. If starting at a higher level, multiply that by the level you are starting at.

> But my character is a wealthy noble! That's fine, but your character only has access to this amount of gold for now. Why your wealth is currently inaccessible is up to you and your GM; unlocking your full riches could be a great quest!

## 5. Languages

All heroes speak Common by default. Each point of INT grants you an additional language known. These languages are typically spoken by:

- Common. Most intelligent creatures.
- Dwarvish. Dwarves, Gnomes, and Giants.
- Elvish. Elves, Fey, and Sylvan.
- Goblin. Goblins and Orcs.
- Infernal. Various Fiends and cultists.
- Thieves' Cant. Scoundrels and rogues.
- Celestial. Celestials and priests.
- Draconic. Dragons, Dragonborn, and Kobolds.
- Primordial. Elementals and Ancient Beings.
- Deep Speak. Underworld dwellers.

> GROFWINT DRAZLON! Speaking another creature's language can open doors that weapons alone cannotbeing heavily armed without the ability to communicate often leads to hostility.

## 6. Other Abilities

Mark any other special abilities you get from your class, ancestry, background, etc.

## 7. Inventory Slots

Each hero has 10+STR inventory slots for carrying equipment and loot (held, worn, or in a pack).

- 1 slot can hold a one-handed weapon, shield, worn armor, stack of javelins, 500 gp, or 2 potions.
- 2 slots can hold a 2-handed weapon, unworn armor, or similarly bulky items.
- Small, related items can be grouped into one slot for simplicity (e.g., Camping Supplies: soap, blanket, brush, rations).

> On Ammunition. In most games, there's no need to track ammo. If you have a quiver, you have enough arrows. Assume the hero collects fired arrows, crafts more, or buys them in town. Alternatively, your GM may allow you to carry what you want without the bookkeeping, so long as you're reasonable!
