## Stats

Heroes have 4 stats that impact their effectiveness in various tasks: 2 Key Stats crucial to their class and 2 Secondary Stats. The maximum a hero's stat can typically go is +5 .

KEY. When an ability or spell references 'KEY,' use one of your Key Stats. If a stat is listed before a die roll, roll a number of dice equal to the stat. For example, 'WIL x d8' means that if your WIL is 2, you roll 2d8 (two eight-sided dice).

|**Strength** (STR)| Your raw physical power and resilience,  endurance,  and  resistance  to  harm. Affects STR weapon damage, resistance to Wounds, HP recovery, Concentration, STR saves, carrying capacity, Grappling, and the Might skill.|
|:---:|---|
| **Intelligence** (INT) |Your Intelligence reflects knowledge and reasoning across fields like the arcane, tactics, or street smarts. Affects languages, spellcasting, use of wands, spell scrolls, INT saves, as well as the Arcana, Examination, and Lore skills. |
| **Dexterity** (DEX) | Your agility, reflexes, and precision with blades or bows. Affects DEX weapon damage, Initiative, DEX saves, Grappling, and can contribute to Armor, as well as the Stealth and Finesse skills. |
| **Will** (WIL) | Your force of personality, courage, and wisdom. Will shapes your interactions with both nature and society. Affects spellcasting and WIL saves, as well as the Insight, Influence, Naturecraft, and Perception skills.|

## Skills

Skills gauge how well your hero interacts with the world. Whenever you tell the GM what you are doing, they may ask you to use one of your skills.

| Arcana (INT) | Your understanding of magical phenomena, spells, and enchantments. With Arcana, you can identify magical effects, decipher arcane symbols, and discern the properties of magical items. It also grants insights into the abilities and weaknesses of magical beings like Aberrations, Elementals, and Oozes.|
|:---:|   |
| Examination (INT) | Your aptitude for thorough analysis and deduction. Use Examination to diagnose injuries, determine causes of death, uncover clues, and unravel the workings of traps or mechanical devices. It also grants insights into the abilities and weaknesses of Constructs.|
| Finesse (DEX) | Your ability to use your hands and feet in careful ways. Use Finesse for activities such as picking locks, disarming traps, piloting vehicles, tinkering, card tricks, stealing or planting items, climbing a mossy wall, or any other task that requires precise, careful movement.|
| Influence (WIL) | Your persuasiveness, charm, and ability to influence others through charisma or cunning. Use Influence to convince or deceive people, negotiate deals, build trust, win allies to your cause, or put on a captivating performance.|
| Insight  (WIL) | Your  ability  to  understand people and situations beyond the obvious. Use Insight to sense motives, detect lies, read hidden emotions, make sense of clues, and when faced with uncertainty-you can think ahead or just 'get' what is happening. Insight can be used to retroactively change situations: Player: 'Oh no! I forgot to buy rope back in town!' GM: 'Give me an Insight check; maybe your hero would have thought about it.'|
| Might (STR) | Your ability to apply strength effectively. Use Might for lifting heavy objects, breaking through obstacles, climbing, swimming, jumping, or performing feats of strength.|
| Lore (INT) | Your understanding of the history of civilization, kingdoms, and religions. Use Lore to recall historical events and grasp the significance of cultural practices. It extends to knowledge of the abilities and behavior of Celestials, Dragons, Fey, Fiends, Giants, Humanoids, and Undead.|
| Naturecraft (WIL) | Your expertise in wilder ness survival, navigation, tracking, and the han dling of animals. Use Naturecraft to thrive in the wild, identify Ŵora, fauna, and tracN creatures with precision. It encompasses knowledge of Beasts, Monstrosities, and Plants, providing insights into their behavior, habitats, and characteristics.|
| Perception (WIL) | Your overall ability to notice subtle details in your surroundings. Use Perception to spot hidden objects, detect secret passages, sense subtle environmental changes, and sense when you're being followed or observed. It encom passes your ability to pick up on non-obvious cues, and hidden threats.|
| Stealth  (DEX) | Your  proficiency  in  staying unseen and moving quietly. Use Stealth to hide, slip past guards, evade detection, and move with out drawing attention.|

## Skill Checks

When you want to affect the world (convince an NPC, spot a trap, pick a lock, etc.), the GM may call for a skill check. Roll 1d20 and add your skill (the max bonus a skill can ever have is +12). If the total meets or exceeds the Difficulty Challenge (DC), you succeed; otherwise, you fail. A roll of 1 always fails regardless of any other bonuses, while a roll of 20 always succeeds. The DC varies based on the task:

| Easy | Spotting a large Ogre crouched behind a small bush might be a DC 8 Perception check.|
|:--| | 
| Medium | A hidden doorway behind a bookcase might be a DC 12 Examination check.|
| Challenging | Calming an injured Owlbear stuck in a trap may be a DC 15 Naturecraft check.|
| Very Difficult | Intuiting the true intentions of a trained Spy may be a DC 18 Insight check.|
| Extremely Difficult | Disarming an ancient legendary trap may be a DC 20+ Finesse check.|

## Saves 

When the world affects you , roll a save instead of a skill check. Roll 1d20 and add the relevant stat. A roll of 1 always fails, 20 always saves. You can choose to fail any save instead of rolling.

|STR Save | When your overall fitness and physicality is tested. STR helps resist forced movement, restraint, poison, and extreme temperatures. |
|---|---|
| DEX Save | When your agility or speed is tested. DEX helps you dive for cover in an explosion or stay on your feet while running across icy terrain. |
| INT Save | When your intelligence is tested. INT helps you see though tricks and illusions. |
| WIL Save | When your courage or personality is tested. WIL helps you resist charm or fear effects. |

Heroes and Saves

- Unless otherwise noted, the DC for effects a hero causes is 10+KEY .
- When making saves, each hero has 1 advantaged save (+), 1 disadvantaged save (-), and 2 neutral saves.

```Example. A Berserker (STR+, INT-) would roll all of his STR saves with advantage and all of his INT saves with disadvantage (see next page).```

## Size

Some spells and abilities affect differently sized objects or creatures. For size, use the following guidelines:

- Tiny can be carried in a typical pocket (many can comfortably fit in 1 space).
- Small can be carried in a backpack (2 can comfortably fit in 1 space).
- Medium is the average human size (1 can comfortably fit in 1 space).
- Large is roughly the size of a bear (1 can comfortably fit in a 2x2 area).
- Huge is roughly the size of a small house (1 can comfortably fit in a 3x3 area).
- Gargantuan can be as large as a castle keep (1 can fill a 4x4 area or greater).

## Advantage & Disadvantage

If you are ever in a favorable situation, the GM may allow you to roll with advantage. To do this, roll 1 additional die of the same type and remove the lowest (see examples below). Alternatively, if the situation is grim or your idea is a long shot, you may have to roll with disadvantage (removing the highest die instead).

If you have multiple instances of advantage or disadvantage, for each one, roll an extra die and remove the lowest (for advantage) or the highest (for disadvantage). Each instance of advantage cancels out one instance of disadvantage before you roll.

```Example 1. Greataxe (2d6) with advantage. Roll 1 additional die and remove the lowest. You hit! See attack rules on pg. 13 for more.```

```Example 2. Greataxe (2d6) with disadvantage 2. Roll 2 additional dice, remove the 2 highest. If there is a tie, always remove dice from left to right. You miss!```
