# Berserker

Wrath and Ruin. The Berserker is destruction. He knows not fatigue nor caution-both surely driven away from him in a relentless fury. Those of barbaric nature are said to eat only the dust of war and drink naught but the blood of those felled by their own hand.

Death is no stranger, for it is said that even death fears to take a Berserker before his battle Rage is satiated. Once a Berserker has begun to fight, he only grows stronger, fueled by battle-lust and an unending Rage. The deadliest among them is not the wellrested, but those who are pushed to the brink through combat. It matters not what a Berserker takes up, be it axe or sword; flesh will be hewn from bone and heads from shoulders. Many have caved under the Berserker's primal might-sword and spell are but straw in the wake of unbridled Rage. As a Berserker, you can:

- Become a raging, damage-dealing machine. Greet death as an old friend and keep on fighting!

- Increase your damage to unbelievable levels. The longer a fight goes on, the more your Rage intensifies, allowing you to deal out incredible amounts of brutality.

- Use your Savage Arsenal. Choose abilities to crush your foes and laugh in the face of death!

## Leveling Table


#### Level 1


!!! info "Rage (Action)"
    Roll a Fury Die (1d4) and set it aside. Add it to every STR attack you make. You can have a max of KEY Fury Dice; they are lost when your Rage ends.
