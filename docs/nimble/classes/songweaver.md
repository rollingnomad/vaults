# Songweaver

Just TRY and resist my charm… wait—NO, don't! Each Songweaver holds a spark granted to them by a muse at birth; a spark which fuels their creative energy and flows forth in the form of a sharp wit, relentless humor, or moving art.

The power of a Songweaver's spark is also evident in their powerful sway over others. Songweavers can bolster and infuse courage in their allies, or… make their enemies' brains leak out through their ears. The Songweaver can bring a whole new meaning to verbal abuse! They can even redirect the (often justified) attacks of others, in order to protect their own moneymakers.

As a Songweaver, you can:

- Charm the hapless people you meet and inspire your allies to reach fantastic new heights of heroism!

- Use your Lyrical Weaponry and powerful charisma to dominate enemies and call special friends to aid you in your journeys and battles. You can even redirect attacks away from yourself and make enemies attack their own allies!

- Control the Battlefield with a chord of chaos, a rad heroic ballad, or a debilitating rhapsody; make your allies and enemies alike dance to your tune!

## Class Features


### Lyrical Weaponry


!!! note "Heroic Ballad"
    +2 max Songweaver's Inspiration charges. When used to reroll an ally's attack, your Songweaver's Inspiration also grants them +WIL damage on the attack.
    


!!! note "Inspiring Anthem (Action)"
    Grant all friendly Dying creatures who can hear you 1 HP and 1 action.
    

    **Usage:** 1/encounter
    


!!! note "Rhapsody of the Normal"
    When you roll 4 or more on your Vicious Mockery, you may spend a Songweaver's Inspiration charge to temporarily suppress any special abilities they have until the end of their next turn. They can do only what an untrained average villager can do: attack once for 1d4 damage and move up to 6 spaces (no armor, spellcasting, flying, regeneration, other inherent or trained features).
    


!!! note "Not My Beautiful Faaace!"
    When you Defend, force the attacker to choose another target within range on a failed WIL save (if there is none, the attack fails). If they fail by 5 or more, they attack themselves as punishment for even thinking they could harm you! On save, they attack you with disadvantage.
    

    **Usage:** 1/encounter
    


!!! note "Song of Domination (2 actions)"
    Play a bewitching tune, and all enemies within 6 spaces who hear it must make a WIL save. If they fail, you move them up to 6 spaces in any direction, and they cannot move on their next turn.
    

    **Usage:** 1/encounter
    



### A 'People' Person


!!! note "Stompy (3 actions)"
    Summon a huge hill giant for 1 round. As he enters the battlefield adjacent to you, use Stompy's Stomp: Make a DC 10 Influence check. On a success, he moves 6 spaces in a direction you choose; on a failure, he moves towards YOU instead (“YOU NOT FRIEND!”). He deals everything in his path damage equal to LVL+Influence check. ANY creature within 6 spaces of Stompy can use this ability once instead of an attack.
    


!!! note "Mal, the Malevolent Imp"
    Summon a tiny fiend for 1 night. He can find out dangerous information you have no right to know! Or 'take care' of a problem with only the slightest chance of things going wrong. Make an Influence check to convince him to help you (advantage if you ask him to do something he would find mischievous or fun; with disadvantage if it is something he would find good or menial).
    


!!! note "Gran Gran (NOT a hag)"
    When resting, you may summon her for 1 hour to soothe your wounds (and hassle you for not eating enough). She bakes and hands out pastries equal to your WIL+INT. Eating one recovers one mana, Hit Die, or Wound. Eat them while they're warm! They expire in 10 minutes.
    


!!! note "Linos, the Everfriendly"
    Summon a legendary flying (but friendly) creature to take you and your party wherever you need to go. He may request a very large amount of food as payment.
