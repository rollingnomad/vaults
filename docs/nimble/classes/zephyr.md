# Zephyr

A Zephyr dedicates their life to the relentless pursuit of kinetic perfection. They hone their bodies into blurs of motion, training from a young age in remote wilds or mountain monasteries, wielding speed to unleash blows that echo through their foes and slip past attacks like a whispering wind. Speed is both their weapon and shield.

Through ceaseless training, they harness their inner momentum to achieve feats of supernatural agility, executing every motion with flowing precision.

The Zephyr is:

- Unarmed and Dangerous. When unarmed and unarmored, you're a relentless force on the battlefield. Absorb blows and deliver devastating strikes, leaving foes in awe of your tenacity and speed.

- A Graceful Combatant. Move with unparalleled speed and determination, outpacing your allies and foes alike. Seize the initiative and strike swiftly, ensuring you're always at the forefront of combat. Your reflexes allow you to retaliate with precision and turn enemy strikes into opportunities for devastating counterattacks.
