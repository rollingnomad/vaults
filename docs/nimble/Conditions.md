## Conditions

Some attacks, traps, spells, or other effects can also inflict conditions-usually negative effects other than damage. Some conditions are temporary, lasting as little as a single round; others may last until cured in some way, and some can be ended by using an action to make an appropriate save.

| Condition | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Blinded** | Can't see. Attacks against you have advantage, and your attacks have disadvantage. |
| **Bloodied** | At half HP or less. |
| **Charmed** | Sees the charmer as an ally. Charmer has advantage on social interactions with you. |
| **Dazed** | Heroes: lose 1 action; monsters: can perform one less action on their next turn. |
| **Dying** | At 0 HP. Taking damage while dying causes 2 Wounds; a crit causes 3 instead. |
| **Restrained** | Functions like Grappled, but is caused by objects (e.g., chains, rope, roots) and ignores size restrictions. It can also be ended through any logical means, such as picking a lock or cutting/burning rope. |
| **Frightened** | Disadvantage on rolls when source of fear is nearby; speed halved when moving closer to it. |
| **Grappled/Restrained** | Cannot move. Attacks against you have advantage. |
| **Hampered** | Any creature with their actions or movement reduced (e.g., Dazed, Grappled, Prone, Difficult Terrain). |
| **Incapacitated** | Can't do anything. Attacks against you have advantage, and melee attacks that hit, crit. |
| **Invisible** | Cannot be seen. Your attacks have advantage, and attacks against you have disadvantage. |
| **Petrified** | Incapacitated. You have all the benefits and drawbacks of being a rock! Immune to most damage except from large explosions, picks, or similar tools. |
| **Poisoned** | Disadvantage on rolls. |
| **Prone** | Movement costs twice as much, and disadvantage on attacks. Melee attacks against you have advantage; Ranged have disadvantage. Spend 3 spaces of your Speed to stand up. |
| **Riding** | You move with the creature you are riding. Any attacks that miss you, strike them. |
| **Slowed** | Speed halved during your next turn. |
| **Taunted** | Disadvantage on attacks except against the most recent taunter. |
| **Wounded** | Has any Wounds (typically 6 Wounds and a hero is dead). |
| **Other Minor Statuses** | Minor statuses (Smoldering, Charged, Distracted, etc.) do nothing on their own and end whenever combat does. Some spells and abilities have additional effects against such targets. |
