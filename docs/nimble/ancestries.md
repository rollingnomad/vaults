# Ancestries

Your kin, lineage, heritage, or race—this is how your character was born and how others see you at first glance.

Choose 1 ancestry and add its bonus to your character sheet.

!!! note "Tenacious"
    +1 to all skills and Initiative.

---
## Dwarf

> Common | Medium

Dwarf, in the old language, means 'stone.' You are resilient, solid, stout. Even when driven to exhaustion, you will not falter. Forgoing speed, you are gifted with physical vitality and a belly that can handle the finest (and worst) consumables this world has to offer.

---
## Elf

!!! note "Lithe"
    Advantage on Initiative, +1 Speed. You know Elvish if your INT is not negative.

---
## Halfling

> Common | Small

Kind of like a human, but smaller (except for the feet). Where does our luck come from? Well…you know what they say about rabbit feet? Well, we've got feet for days compared to them. Imagine the amount of luck you could fit into these bad boys!

!!! note "Elusive"
    +1 to Stealth. If you fail a save, you can succeed instead, 1/Safe Rest.

---
## Gnome

> Common | Small

Eccentric, curious, and perpetually optimistic, gnomes are cheerful—especially when compared to their typically grumpier and larger kin, the dwarves. Known for their tinkering, spreading cheer, and playful antics, gnomes pursue their passions with a scatterbrained enthusiasm.

!!! note "Optimistic"
    Allow an ally within Reach 6 to reroll any single die, resets when healed to your max HP. -1 Speed. You know Dwarvish if your INT is not negative (but you call it Gnomish, of course).

---
## Bunbun

Bunbun are agile and unpredictable, using their powerful legs to leap great distances and catch foes off guard. Facing a Bunbun means contending with an opponent who can strike from unexpected angles and swiftly reposition themselves in the heat of battle.

!!! note "Bunny Legs"
    Before Interposing or after Defending (after damage), hop up to your Speed in any direction for free, 1/encounter.

---
## Dragonborn

> Exotic | Medium

The soul of a dragon burns within you, the scales of your body are like forged steel. You are a kiln and your heritage the coals that stoke your flames. Call upon your wrath, to speak in the tongue of your ancestors and imbue unbridled fury into your attacks.

!!! note "Draconic Heritage"
    +1 Armor. When you attack: deal an additional LVL+KEY damage (ignoring armor) divided as you choose among any of your targets; recharges whenever you Safe Rest or gain a Wound. You know Draconic if your INT is not negative.

---
## Fiendkin

> Exotic | Medium

Said to have been born from the union of man and fiend, or from a cursed bloodline, Fiendkin often find themselves outcasts in society. Yet, they embody determination in the face of adversity. Their ancestors didn't emerge from the depths of the Everflame to succumb to minor setbacks!

!!! note "Flameborn"
    1 of your neutral saves is advantaged instead. You know Infernal if your INT is not negative.

---
## Goblin

> Exotic | Small

Green, cunning, and perpetually vilified, Goblins thrive on the edge of chaos. For a Goblin, vanishing into the shadows is not just a skill—it's an identity. After all, what kind of Goblin would you be if you couldn't slip away unnoticed?

    Can move 2 spaces for free after you become the target of an attack or negative effect (after damage, ignoring difficult terrain). You know Goblin if your INT is not negative.

---
## Kobold

---
## Orc

> Exotic | Medium

Just when you think you've bested a mighty Orc, you've merely succeeded in rousing their anger. Engaging in combat with an Orc is no endeavor for the weak-willed. While others may cower before death's approach, Orcs boldly defy its grasp.

!!! note "Relentless"
    When you would drop to 0 HP, you may set your HP to LVL instead, 1/Safe Rest. +1 Might. You know Goblin if your INT is not negative (but you call it Orcish, of course).

---
## Birdfolk

> Exotic | Small or Medium

Birdfolk find sanctuary not in stone or chains, but within the boundless expanse of the sky. However, the gift of flight comes at a cost—hollow bones, and commensurate frailty.

!!! note "Hollow Bones"
    You have a fly Speed as long as you are wearing armor no heavier than Leather. Crits against you are Vicious (the attacker rolls 1 additional die). Forced movement moves you twice as far.

---

    Your disadvantaged save is Neutral instead. You know Celestial if your INT isn't negative.

---
## Changeling

> Exotic | Medium

Often hunted for their silver blood, Changelings are natural survivors, slipping into new identities with ease. Changelings that shift too often typically aren't long for the world—they can struggle to remember who they once were, becoming little more than reflections of the faces they wear.

---
## Dryad/Shroomling

> Exotic | Small or Med

!!! note "Danger Pollen/Spores"
    Whenever an enemy causes you one or more Wounds, you excrete soporific spores: all adjacent enemies are Dazed. You know Elvish if your INT is not negative.

---
## Half-Giant

> Exotic | Large

Towering beings whose strength is as immovable as the mountains they call home. Their sheer size and resilience make them fearsome opponents, capable of surviving even devastating blows.

---

---
## Oozeling/Construct

> Exotic | Small or Med

What even is a 'PeOpLe' anyway? So what if your heart pumps oil instead of blood, so what if you don't even have a heart!? If you can squish yourself into a pair of pants, or swing a sword like everyone else, who's to say you can't be a pEOpLe, too?!

!!! note "Odd Constitution"
    Increment your Hit Dice one step (d6 » d8 » d10 » d12 » d20); they always heal you for the maximum amount. Magical healing always heals you for the minimum amount.

---
## Planarbeing

You are not from this plane of existence—your soul is not as strongly tethered to it as others. But with this vulnerability comes power, the ability to temporarily shift from one plane to another in times of dire need.

!!! note "Planeshift"
    Whenever you Defend, you can gain 1 Wound to temporarily phase out of the material plane and ignore the damage. -2 max Wounds.

---

Ratfolk are survivors, thriving in the shadows of society where others fear to tread. Agile, resourceful, and fiercely loyal to their own, they have a knack for turning scraps into solutions.

!!! note "Scurry"
    Gain +2 armor if you moved on your last turn.

---
## Stoatling

> Exotic | Small

Stoatlings may be small, but they're far from weak. With fierce determination and warrior hearts, they can take down foes many times their size. Their agility and tenacity let them exploit larger enemies' weaknesses, turning their size into a lethal advantage.

!!! note "Small But Ferocious"
    Whenever you make a single-target attack against a creature larger than you, roll 1 additional d6 for each size category it is larger. They do the same.

---
## Turtlefolk

> Exotic | Small or Med

Turtlefolk take their time in everything they do; they are patient, sturdy, and slow to anger. They rely on their thick shells for protection, making them difficult to harm, but their cautious movements come at the cost of speed.

!!! note "Slow & Steady"
    +4 Armor, -2 speed.

---
## Wyrdling

> Exotic | Small

Unpredictable and chaotic, Wyrdlings are the result of magic gone awry. Their bodies pulse with raw arcane energy, and their mere presence often disturbs the balance of magic around them.

!!! note "Chaotic Surge"
    Whenever you or a willing ally within Reach 6 casts a tiered spell, you may allow them to roll on the Chaos Table. 1/encounter.
