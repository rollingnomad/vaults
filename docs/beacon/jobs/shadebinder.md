    - Any Support Item or Technique that Doesn't Require an Action to Activate: When you create a Summon, you can choose for it to also receive any passive benefits granted by this item or technique. This lasts until it is defeated or dismissed. The Summon doesn't gain the ability to use any actions granted by this item or technique - just the passive benefits. Only one Summon can benefit from this ability at a time.
    - Any Equipment or Technique with the Summon Tag: When you regain {HP}, Summons created with the enchanted equipment or technique regain half as much {HP}. This only affects Summons that are currently in play.

    When you call forth a Summon, you can spend 1 MP to forge a link between you. As long as you are both in play, any time either of you takes damage (after {ARMOR} and resistances), the damage is split between both characters.

    The link lasts for the end of the scene, or until one of the characters is defeated or you end the effect as a free action.
