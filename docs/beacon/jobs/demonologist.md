## Limit Break


??? danger "**Limit Break: Legion**"
    - **Action:** (3) Volley
    - **Range:** 
    - **Tags:** Mana 1
    - **Specific Type:** Limit Break
    
    You immediately conjure up to 4 Summons drawn from all of your Summon abilities, ignoring their normal limits on quantity of Summons but otherwise following their usual restrictions. At the end of each of your turns, if any of these Summons exceed the number usually imposed by that ability, one of them is automatically affected by your Sacrifice trait regardless of {Range} and line of sight.
    Until the end of the scene, if the defeat of one of your Summons would result in the destruction of the underlying ability (like with Gert's Backbone), the ability is only destroyed if the last instance of that Summon is defeated.
