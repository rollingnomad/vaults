## Limit Break


??? danger "**Limit Break: Gateway**"
    - **Action:** Minor Action
    - **Range:** 
    - **Tags:** 
    - **Specific Type:** Limit Break
    
    You create two SIZE 3 gateways on free solid surfaces within [{Range} 15], ignoring line of sight. These gateways aren't obstructions, don't block line of sight, and last until the end of the scene.
    1/turn when a character fully enters a gateway, they are immediately teleported to the other gateway, being placed in a space of their choice so they are fully within the gateway. If a character enters a gateway as a result of forced movement, their forced movement continues in the same direction from the other gateway starting in a space chosen by whoever initiated the forced movement.
    If a character cannot end this teleport fully within the gateway (e.g., because too many spaces are occupied), the teleport fails.
