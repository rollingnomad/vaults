# Conditions, Statuses, and Tags

---

## CONDITIONS

Conditions are always negative. Most effects that give conditions indicate when the conditions end (e.g., 'until the end of the target's next turn'). They can also be cleared with REFRESH.

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| BLINDED | BLINDED characters can only target and draw line of sight to adjacent spaces. |
| DAZED | DAZED characters receive +1 on all attacks, checks, and saves. |
| DISARMED | DISARMED characters can't make weapon attacks except for improvised weapon attacks. |
| IMMOBILIZED | IMMOBILIZED characters can't voluntarily move, but can still be subjected to forced and involuntary movement. |
| MARKED | When attacking a MARKED character, the attacker can choose to consume the MARK. Doing this clears MARKED and grants +1 on that attack roll. A character can only have one MARK at a time. |
| SILENCED | SILENCED characters can't use or RELEASE spells. |
| SLOWED | SLOWED characters can only move with their standard movement; they can't RUSH or use any other forms of voluntary movement.<br><br>SLOWED PCs can only take their turns in PHASE DELAY. SLOWED NPCs have their next Initiative become 8 (this lasts until they've taken that turn and the condition ends). During rounds in which they are SLOWED, Bosses must take at least one of their turns during PHASE DELAY, even if they clear the condition before doing so. |
| STUNNED | STUNNED characters can perform either a standard action or a minor action on their turns, not both. Additionally, they can't FULL ATTACK or perform reactions, and their DODGE and A-DEF both count as 5. |
| SUNDERED | SUNDERED characters don't benefit from ARMOR or resistance. |
| VULNERABLE | VULNERABLE characters take double damage from Physical, Astral, Lunar, and Force sources. Stress and Discord are not affected. |
| WEAKENED | WEAKENED characters deal half damage when dealing Physical, Force, Astral, and Lunar. Stress and Discord are not affected. Their Summons and Traps are also unaffected. |

## STATUSES

Statuses describe characters' current states, and can be positive or negative. Unlike conditions, they can't be removed unless specific actions are taken or their requirements no longer apply.

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| BLOODIED | Characters are BLOODIED when they have half of their HP maximum or less (their BLOODIED level). |
| BREAKING | Characters are BREAKING when they have Stress equal to or exceeding half their STRESS CAP (their BREAKING point). |
| ENGAGED | When a character becomes adjacent to an enemy, they both gain the ENGAGED status as long as they are adjacent to one another. ENGAGED characters make ranged attacks at +1. If a character becomes ENGAGED by another character of the same SIZE or larger, their movement ends and they lose any unused movement. Characters cease to be ENGAGED when they are no longer adjacent to an enemy. |
| FLYING | Characters with flight can either take off, gaining the FLYING status, or land on the ground, clearing the status, as a free action once per turn. They can also choose to start combat scenes FLYING.<br><br>While a character is FLYING, the following effects apply:<br> > Non-thrown melee attacks from nonFLYING characters gain +2 against them.<br> > They can move normally over and are immune to the effects of terrain, obstructions, and terrain features, but cannot benefit from or interact with them either. When flying over objects, they are considered to have their SIZE increased by the SIZE of whatever they are flying over for the purposes of determining line of sight and cover, as if they were climbing.<br> > They cannot benefit from cover from terrain or objects.<br> > When attacking nonFLYING characters, they treat their target's cover from terrain and objects as one step lower (hard cover becomes soft cover, soft cover becomes no cover).<br> > They ignore ENGAGEMENT and don't cause ENGAGEMENT.<br> > They don't trigger Traps but can still be affected by them.<br> > They cease to be FLYING if they become PRONE. |
| GRAPPLED | GRAPPLED always involves at least two characters, both of whom receive the status. While GRAPPLED, the following effects apply:<br> > Both characters are ENGAGED.<br> > Neither character can take reactions.<br> > The larger character can move normally.<br> > The smaller character is IMMOBILIZED, but is dragged along by the larger character when they move, mirroring their movements and inheriting any special forms of movement like flight.<br> > If the initiator is the same SIZE as the target, they count as the larger one during the turn in which they initiate the GRAPPLE.<br> > Characters of the same SIZE can make a contested BULK check as a free action to see if they count as the larger one until this contest is repeated.<br><br>GRAPPLED ends when one of the following occurs:<br> > The characters are no longer adjacent to each other.<br> > The initiator ends it as a free action.<br> > The GRAPPLE target succeeds on a contested BULK check as a minor action. |
| HIDDEN | While a character is HIDDEN, enemies can only target them with AOEs or while adjacent to them. They are still visible on the combat map to players and the GM. The following things end HIDDEN:<br> > The HIDDEN character uses a hostile effect (e.g., attacking or forcing a save) or uses INTERPOSE.<br> > The HIDDEN character ends any turn within an enemy's line of sight unless they are either INVISIBLE or benefiting from cover against that enemy.<br> > An enemy performs a successful SEARCH against them. |
| INVISIBLE | When making an attack against an INVISIBLE character, before any attack rolls are made, roll a d6. On a 1-3, the attack misses. INVISIBLE characters are still visible on the map to players and the GM. INVISIBLE lasts until the end of the scene unless stated otherwise. |
| PRONE | Attacks against PRONE targets gain +1 and PRONE characters always count as moving through difficult terrain. Unless they are IMMOBILIZED, PRONE characters can stand instead of making their standard movement, which ends this status. Standing doesn't count as a form of movement. |

## TAGS

Abilities often have tags associated with them, such as Aura 2, Piercing, or Polymorph. When an ability has a tag, the effects of that tag apply to the effects of that ability. Some abilities don't have tags, but do have effects that have a tag, or that create objects or characters with the tag, as indicated in their description.

If an ability has a tag with a value of 'X', like Mana X, that means the amount can vary, but must be at least 1. Below is a list of tags and their effects.

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Accurate | Attacks with this tag gain +1. |
| Aetheric | Attacks with this tag are made against A-DEF instead of DODGE. |
| Arcing | Abilities with this tag can be aimed over obstacles. They ignore line of sight as long as there is a vertical path to the target, although cover still applies. |
| Armor | Abilities with this tag represent suits of armor or similar defenses, many of which provide a bonus to ARMOR. A character can only have one ability with this tag equipped at a time. |
| Aura X | When activated, abilities with this tag affect indicated characters within X spaces of the user. A character can only have one Aura activated at a time and can change Auras 1/turn. |
| Auto-Hit | Attacks with this tag automatically hit without making an attack roll. |
| Blast X | Abilities with this tag have an AOE. It affects all targets within a radius of X spaces from the center space, including the center space. Cover and line of sight are calculated from the center space. Users can be affected by their own Blast. |
| Burst X | Affects all targets within a radius of X spaces from the edge of the spaces occupied by the target, including the target's spaces but excluding the target itself. Cover and line of sight are calculated from the edge of the spaces occupied by the target. If a Burst forms a zone, the zone moves with the target. |
| Close Blast X | Abilities with this tag have an AOE. It operates like a Blast, but:<br>’ at least 1 space must be adjacent to the user<br>’ the user can't be in the area<br>’ cover and line of sight are calculated from the user. |
| Consumable X | Abilities with this tag can only be used X times per quest. Consumable abilities represent potions, elixirs, and other items that can be replenished. |
| Enchantment | Abilities with this tag modify other abilities. Enchantments can typically only be applied to specific types of abilities and can only be applied to one ability at a time. Additionally, each ability can only have one Enchantment at a time. Traits and talents can't be enchanted. |
| Focus X | Abilities with this tag cost X Focus to use. |
| Homing | Abilities with this tag ignore line of sight and the effects of cover. As long as the target is within Range and it is possible to reach them (i.e., they aren't in a box), they can be targeted. |
| Inaccurate | Attacks with this tag receive +1. |
| Indirect | Attacks with this tag ignore any from cover. |
| Innate | Abilities with this tag can't be destroyed or enchanted. They can't be chosen for destruction as the result of a wound roll. |
| Limited X | Abilities with this tag can only be used X times per quest. Limited abilities provide powerful effects that can't be replenished during a quest once used. |
| Line X | Abilities with this tag have an AOE. It affects all targets in a straight line with a length of X spaces and a width of 1 space, drawn directly away from you in any direction. |
| Mana X | Abilities with this tag cost X MP to use. |
| Piercing | Damage with this tag ignores ARMOR. |
| Polymorph | Abilities with this tag modify the target's form. A character can only be under the effect of one ability with this tag at a time, and any subsequent polymorph effects are automatically cancelled while they are under the effects of a polymorph. |
| Pull X | Abilities with this tag inflict a type of forced movement. On a hit, the target is moved X spaces directly toward the origin. |
| Push X | Abilities with this tag inflict a type of forced movement. On a hit, the target is moved X spaces directly away from the origin. |
| Range X | Abilities with this tag can be used on targets within X spaces. |
| Reach X | Abilities with this tag can be used on targets within X spaces. This tag also determines the range of the OPPORTUNITY ATTACK reaction. |
| Reliable X | Abilities with this tag always deal at least X damage, even if they would miss or deal less than X damage. Reliable damage inherits the ability's damage type and tags; however, Reliable damage does not count as a hit and doesn't trigger any effects that require a hit. |
| Reloading | Abilities with this tag must be reloaded after each use before they can be used again. This can be done using REFRESH and other abilities. |
| Slide X | Abilities with this tag inflict a type of forced movement. On a hit, the target is moved X spaces in any direction. |
| Slow | Abilities with this tag can only be activated as part of FULL ATTACK. |
| Stressful X | Abilities with this tag inflict X Stress on the user. |
| Summon | Abilities with this tag create one or more temporary characters under the control of another character, each of which has the Summon tag.<br>By default, each character can only have one Summon per ability with this tag in play at a time. If a Summon is defeated or dismissed, a new one can be made using that same ability. Summons can't create Summons. Summons have the following statistics unless otherwise indicated:<br> > SIZE 1/2<br> > HP 5<br> > DODGE/A-DEF 10<br> > SPEED 0<br> > SAVE TARGET = Summoner's SAVE TARGET<br> > BULK / AGILITY / MIND / MAGIC 0<br>Summons can only be created in free spaces that they could normally enter (they can't be summoned into impassable terrain, for example).<br>Summons are characters with a standard action, standard movement, and minor action per round; however, they can't perform any actions unless they have an ability that lets them do so and can't perform a movement unless they have SPEED. Their turn is their summoner's turn, and if they can take actions or move, they can do so at any point in their summoner's turn.<br>Summons are defeated if they are reduced to 0 HP. They can also be dismissed by their summoner as a free action. Summons last until dismissed or defeated, or until the end of the scene.|
| Thrown X | Abilities with this tag can be used to make a thrown attack, a melee attack made against a target within X spaces. Thrown attacks are affected by cover. If throwing a weapon, it lands in a space adjacent to the target (thrower's choice), and must be picked up as a free action while adjacent to it before it can be used again. |
| Trap | Abilities with this tag place traps - objects that modify spaces - or are traps themselves. They must be placed in a free adjacent space. They become armed at the end of the turn in which they are placed. Moving into or adjacent to a space occupied by a trap triggers it, activating its effects, after which it is removed from play.<br>Traps are permanently HIDDEN, but can be automatically detected with SEARCH. You can attempt to disarm a trap by making an AGILITY check as a minor action when moving into or adjacent to its space (before it is triggered). On a success, the trap is removed from play without being activated. On a failure, it activates as normal. |
| Unbreakable | Abilities with this tag cannot be destroyed and can't be selected for destruction if there are nonUnbreakable options left. If an Unbreakable result is selected from a wound or overstress roll, it becomes a DAZED result instead. |
| Unique | Characters can only equip one copy of each ability with this tag at a time. |
