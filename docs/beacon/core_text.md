## SECTION 1 GETTING STARTED

## 0: INTRODUCTION

BEACON is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) inspired by the high fantasy stories of the Final Fantasy video games and the tactical gameplay of the Lancer and Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4th Edition TTRPGs. High-action, tactical combat scenes are at the core of BEACON , supported by a streamlined and engaging narrative system that lets you get to the action quickly. Create unique and interesting characters, explore fantastical worlds with your friends, and confront the deadly dangers and obstacles that stand in your way!

## A World of Your Own

In BEACON , you create your own unique setting together, called a Reflection .

Games of BEACON take place in the Source, a wellspring of endless potential and stories. While the true nature of the Source is incomprehensibly complex, it is often represented as a giant crystal with infinite facets. Each facet is a different Reflection, and each Reflection is a unique reality.

While there are infinite stories that can be told within the Source, there are commonalities across its facets. The following are true of each Reflection:

- Ø The  world  is  filled  with action and adventure .
- Ø All  things  are  composed of aether ,  a magical element that comes in many varieties, including astral and lunar forms.
- Ø Magic is widely available and has been combined with technology to  create magitech devices.
- Ø There are beacons -  people  who are sources of great inspiration for others, whether they are heroes or villains.
- Ø There is a recurring threat to the Reflection - the Scourge .
- Ø Crystals hold some significance to the Reflection or its inhabitants.
- Ø Ruins dot the landscape, ready to be explored.

The GM and players work together to define the specific details of the Reflection in which their game takes place, including its history, peoples, and cultures. This process is detailed in Chapter 10: Game Master's Guide (p. 223).

## Two Modes of Play

BEACON features two modes of play narrative play and combat .  While playing, you will move between these two modes, which each have their own unique set of rules.

During narrative play, you tell stories about your characters and the world in which they live. Narrative play is rules-light, allowing players to shape the narrative without getting bogged down by mechanics.

In combat play, your characters - customized and equipped in countless ways - enter battle. Combat play is tactical and rules-heavy, with plenty of scope for unique builds and playstyles.

## You are a Beacon

Your characters in the game are known as beacons. Beacons are powerful heroes who help and inspire others. Every Reflection has its own unique take on what beacons are and what they do.

Participants in BEACON take on one of two roles: either that of a player or that of the game master ( GM ).

The goal of all participants is to tell a shared story, and to have fun doing so. Each player creates a single player character ( PC ) - a heroic figure called a ' beacon ' - and explores the game through that character's story. The GM, on the other hand, controls all of the non-player characters ( NPCs ), sets up combat scenes, and helps shape the narrative.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

BEACON has six core principles:

- 1 The well-being and fun of the group, including both the players and the GM, is the top priority.
- 2 Specific text takes precedent over general text.
- 3 BEACON does not model reality or real-life physics, and is not meant to.
- 4 Narrative play and combat play are distinct modes of play. The ability to do something in one does not automatically grant the ability to do it in the other.
- 5 In combat play, players can do anything their abilities allow, even if it doesn't make narrative sense.
- 6 Always round up to the nearest whole number.

## GENERAL TEXT VS. SPECIFIC TEXT

General text includes basic rules of the game, such as 'The FIGHT action is used to make a melee or improvised weapon attack.'

Specific text is more granular or detailed than general text. For example, the SLOW tag specifies that, 'Abilities with this tag can only be activated as part of FULL ATTACK . '  This means that a SLOW weapon can't be used as part of the FIGHT action, because the text of the SLOW tag is more specific than the text of the FIGHT action.

## COMBAT AND NARRATIVE SCENES

BEACON ' s gameplay is split into scenes . A scene is a series of events that focus on a person, place, or challenge. Each scene is either a narrative scene or a combat scene , falling under the rules of either combat play or narrative play .

The GM determines when one scene ends and another begins, and whether the scenes are narrative or combat. But anyone can suggest or request a scene, and you are encouraged to do so.

Combat scenes use the rules for combat play (p. 41). These scenes feature important fights and battles. Not every fight is worthy of a combat scene; only those that are important or tactically challenging move into combat play. A simple street fight or barroom brawl, for example, wouldn't start a combat scene. A fight on a crumbling bridge against a horde of demons, or a climactic showdown with an archnemesis would be worthy of a combat scene.

Example: An angry necromancer has performed a ritual in a nearby cemetery, creating a continuous stream of undead soldiers that attack nearby towns. The beacons are asked to stop the necromancer and break the ritual. The GM sets up a combat scene with the beacons fighting in a misty cemetery against undead hordes and a necromancer riding an animated mausoleum!

Narrative scenes, on the other hand, use the rules for narrative play (p. 22). Any scene that isn't a combat scene is considered a narrative scene. These scenes involve challenges that are resolved by rolling dice (called 'skill checks') or roleplaying. Small-scale fights can even happen during narrative play, but these fights are resolved just like any other challenge that happens during narrative play, using skill checks and roleplaying instead of the combat play rules.

Example: The beacons need to get to a floating island and the only way to get there is with an airship. They don't have one, so they ask the GM for a scene with the Artificer's Guild. The GM sets up a scene in which the beacons meet the guildmaster directly. The beacons attempt to convince the guildmaster to let them borrow an airship, using a mix of roleplaying and skill checks to determine how successful their attempts are.

## STRUCTURE OF PLAY

The gameplay of BEACON revolves around quests (p. 241). Quests are missions, tasks, or jobs provided to the beacons by the GM. Quests contain both combat and narrative scenes, connecting them to tell stories. The quests that your characters participate in form the body of your campaign , which is the overarching story of your characters.

For example, your group's primary motivation might be to defeat a great evil. In order to gain the strength, allies, and resources to do so, they might need to

undertake a number of quests, preparing themselves for the final showdown with their foe.

The time between quests uses the rules for narrative play. During this time, the players collaboratively tell their beacons' stories and explore the world.

When the players are ready to begin a new quest, they equip their beacons with abilities they've unlocked that they think will best suit the upcoming quest and the combat scenes within it.

When the beacons return from a quest, they level up (p. 14) and become more powerful. This allows them to combine abilities and equipment from multiple classes (p. 84) to create unique playstyles and character configurations.

## DICE

During both narrative play and combat, players roll dice to determine success, failure, and other interesting outcomes. BEACON uses two types of dice: 20-sided dice ( d20 ) and 6-sided dice ( d6 ). The rules sometimes call for a d3 , which can be represented with a d6. A result of 1-2 equals 1, 3-4 equals 2, and 5-6 equals 3.

A number in front of the type of die indicates how many dice of that type to roll. 3d6 means you roll 3 six-sided dice.

## ATTACKS, CHECKS, AND SAVES

There are three main types of dice rolls in BEACON : attack rolls , checks , and saves .  They each use a single d20. Any time you're making one of these rolls, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers to the result - bonuses or penalties to the roll based on beneficial or disadvantageous situations. The final result is your total for the roll.

## ATTACKS

Attacks are hostile actions taken against other characters in combat play. They are usually made with weapons, spells, or skills. When attacking, you add your beacon's GRIT score to the roll. See Chapter 5: Combat Play (p. 41) for more information.

## CHECKS

Checks are rolls to determine how successful challenging actions are. There are two types of checks that you might make: skill checks and ability checks . To make a check of either type, you roll a d20 and add any relevant modifiers. To succeed, you need a total of 10 or more (after modifiers).

Skill checks are used in narrative play. If one of a character's background skills (p. 12) would be helpful for the roll they're making, or they can invoke their title (p. 11), they can get a bonus on to the roll. See Chapter 4: Narrative Play (p. 22) for more information.

Ability checks , by contrast, are used in combat play. They use the character's relevant ability score -BULK , AGILITY , MIND , or MAGIC - as a modifier (p. 49).

During combat play, characters sometimes need to make contested checks . In a contested check, the two relevant parties each roll an ability check. Whoever gets the highest total succeeds, with ties going to the one who attacked or initiated the action.

## SAVES

Saves are rolls made to resist effects during combat play. Effects that prompt a save indicate which of the target's ability scores to use as a modifier. Each character has a SAVE TARGET , which is the total their opponents must meet or exceed when rolling saves. When there is no SAVE TARGET indicated, it defaults to 10 .

## MODIFIERS

There are three types of modifiers that can affect rolls, increasing or decreasing their results:

- Ø Accuracy ( )
- Ø Difficulty ( )
- Ø Static modifiers (+1, -4, etc.).

Bonuses from your beacon's ability scores and GRIT count as static modifiers.

## ACCURACY AND DIFFICULTY

Various effects can apply Accuracy or Difficulty to a d20 roll.

For each or , roll 1d6 and take the single highest result out of the  dice rolled. If rolling with , this number is added to the total as a positive modifier . If rolling with , it is subtracted from the total as a negative modifier . For example, if you are rolling with 2 , you would roll 2d6 and keep the single highest result out of all the dice. If you rolled a 2 and a 4, you would keep the 4.

Rolls can be affected by multiple instances of or , although they cancel each other out on a one-toone basis. For example, a roll could receive 4 and 2 ; however, the 2 would cancel out 2 , leaving the roll with 2 . Always determine the final amount of or before rolling any dice.

An individual roll can't benefit from more than 6 or .

## 2: ANATOMY OF A BEACON

This chapter walks through the steps of creating a character and outlines the various components that define them.

In BEACON , the characters created and portrayed by the players are special individuals known as 'beacons' . They are called this because of the way they act like shining lights to others. There is no one way that beacons act or conduct themselves; no matter what, they always find themselves in positions where they can inspire or help others.

The precise characteristics that make someone a beacon differ between Reflections. In one Reflection, beacons might be mystically empowered individuals born under a strange star. In another, they might be students with an abundance of charisma.

Beacons don't need a reason to be special in your game. The fact they are controlled by a player already makes them special, and grants them the opportunity to influence and change the story as it's told. Your game could be about a band of heroes destined to save the world, or it could be about a found family, fighting to keep itself safe.

The only constant across all Reflections is that beacons inspire people around them. Even those who are cowardly or timid have the potential and opportunity, as a group, to give hope to others.

Chapter 10: Game Master's Guide details some example Reflections and the roles of beacons within them (p. 233).

## CHARACTER CREATION

This section will guide you through the steps of creating a beacon.

Every beacon has a character level (p. 14). Character levels represent the overall growth and power of a beacon. Higher-level beacons have more abilities available to them, and can therefore handle a wider variety of situations.

Your beacon begins at character level 1 . At level 1, they have:

- Ø a name and a title
- Ø three rank 1 background skills (p. 12)
- Ø 2 ability points (p. 12)
- Ø three rank 1 talents (p. 13)
- Ø an ancestry (p. 13)
- Ø one class rank (p. 13)
- Ø access to all basic equipment and techniques (p. 13)
- Ø an appearance (p. 13).

Once you have finished these steps, you will determine your beacon's attributes, which are values used in combat play (p. 14).

## NAME

## Choose a name for your beacon.

Beacons can have any sort of name, from the mundane to the grandiose. Alternatively, you can decide this later. You might not have an idea for a name yet, but might think of one after picking your background skills or ancestry. There are also plenty of random name generators online that you can use for inspiration.

Example: Shawn is creating her first beacon. She likes the name Dhalia, so she uses it for her character.

## TITLE

## Choose a title for your beacon.

When the stories of your character and their fellow beacons become legend, how will they be remembered? What will they be called when their name falls into obscurity and all that survives is their deeds?

People recognize your beacon by this title, even if they don't know their name. Titles can reference anything from a fighting style to a physical trait or even an aesthetic.

Example titles: The Green Knight, the Herald of Silence, the Bosstown Bludgeon, Moonfang, the Timeless Bard.

Whenever you make a skill check during narrative play, you can invoke your beacon's title before rolling to gain a +2 bonus .  T o invoke a title, the action in question must be something that contributes to the legend of your character's title. Think of a story being told about your beacon, their name lost to history and only their title remaining. Would this make it into the story?

Example: Shawn likes the idea of playing someone smart; a knowledge-seeker. She gives Dhalia the title of 'the All-Knowing' . Shawn can invoke this title when doing something that contributes to the legacy of 'the All-Knowing' beacon. For example, if Dhalia is making a skill check to piece together the conspiracy behind the Day of Shadows, she can invoke her title to gain a +2 bonus to the roll. If Dhalia is making a skill check to climb a mountain, on the other hand, being all-knowing is less likely to be helpful, and couldn't be invoked.

The GM decides whether a title can be invoked or not. Players are encouraged to find creative explanations for why a beacon's title might apply, but they're not meant to be used in every situation.

If you find that your title is too easy to invoke, consider rephrasing it to limit its scope.

Example: Delmar's beacon is Dmitri, 'the Demigod' . After playing a few sessions, he realizes that 'the Demigod' can be invoked in  every  situation. Delmar rephrases the title as 'the Demigod of Determination', which puts some limits on when it can be invoked.

## WRITING YOUR LEGEND

One way you can use titles is as a way of documenting the legend of your beacon. Whenever you invoke their title, write down what it was being used for and what the outcome was. When you're finished playing that character, look over everything that was written down. This is the foundation for the legends told about your beacon for generations to come.

GettinG Started

## BACKGROUND SKILLS

At level 1, create three rank 1 background skills.

Background skills are words or brief phrases that represent a beacon's history and training, and provide bonuses to skill checks. Background skills have three ranks. When you make a skill check in narrative play and one of your background skills is relevant, you get +1 on your roll for each rank you have in that skill. Each skill check can only benefit from one background skill, which must be decided before rolling.

Background skills can be anything, so make sure they're evocative. Instead of just ' Acrobat ' , make it something interesting like, ' Acrobat Performer for the Demon Circus ' .

Example background skills: Will of the Source, TrollWrestling Champion, An Eye for Lies, Royal Assassin.

When creating a background skill, think about what situations it might be relevant in. If it seems like it would apply to every skill check you might make, you should narrow its focus more.

Every time your beacon levels up they get a background skill point. These points can be used to either increase the rank of an existing background skill (to a maximum of rank 3 ), or create a new background skill at rank 1.

Example: Shawn  creates  a  background  skill 'Truthseeker' for Dhalia. This can be used any time Dhalia is trying to learn the truth about something, whether researching in books or detecting lies.

Shawn also thinks that Dhalia should know lightbased magic, so she creates the background skill 'Disciple of the Sun' , which would apply whenever she uses magic.

Finally, Shawn creates the background skill 'Multipurpose Clothing' because she likes the idea of Dhalia having clothes with secondary benefits, like a cloak that can be used as a paraglider. She would apply this background skill whenever she can think of a fun way to solve a problem with clothes.

## ABILITY SCORES

At level 1, assign 2 ability points.

Your beacon has four ability scores that affect their attributes and actions in combat play:

- Ø BULK
- Ø AGILITY
- Ø MIND
- Ø MAGIC

Ability scores range from +0 to +6 , and give bonuses in combat play. By default, they start at +0 .

Each ability score also provides bonuses to some of your character's other attributes (p. 14). For example, AGILITY affects the character's DODGE and SPEED .

Assigning an ability point to an ability score increases it by +1. At level 1, this means you can have two ability scores at +1 each, or one ability score at +2.

## Bulk

BULK determines how tough and sturdy a character is in combat. You gain:

- Ø +2 HP for every point of BULK
- Ø +1 RECOVERY for every two points of BULK

## Agility

AGILITY determines how fast and evasive a character is in combat. You gain:

- Ø +1 DODGE for every point of AGILITY
- Ø +1 SPEED for every two points of AGILITY

## Mind

MIND determines how much mental strain a character can handle, and how well they can remember their training in combat. You gain:

- Ø +1 STRESS CAP for every point of MIND
- Ø +1 MEMORY for every two points of MIND

## Magic

MAGIC determines how magically adept a character is in combat. You gain:

- Ø +1 AETHERIC DEFENSE (A-DEF) for every point of MAGIC
- Ø +1 MP for every two points of MAGIC

Example: Shawn wants Dhalia to be a spellcaster with a variety of spells, so she assigns 1 ability point to MIND and 1 to MAGIC .

Delmar wants Dmitri to be as tough as possible, so he assigns 2 ability points to BULK .

## TALENTS

At level 1, choose three rank 1 talents. See p. 202 for the full list of talents and their abilities.

While many of the abilities available to beacons are tied to their class (see below), talents are sets of abilities that can be acquired by any beacon and that don't need to be equipped. Once your beacon has learned a talent, they will always have access to any abilities unlocked by their ranks in that talent.

Each talent has three ranks , each with its own ability. When your beacon first gains a talent, they get access to it at rank 1. If you assign additional points to that talent, you can get that talent's rank 2 and eventually its rank 3 ability.

Beacons gain additional talents and can even change their talent choices when they level up (p. 14).

Example: Shawn wants to pick magical-sounding talents  for  Dhalia.  She  picks  the Archmage , Enchanter , and Leyline Walker talents because they sound like they will assist with magic. She doesn't spend much time reviewing all the options because she knows she can change them later.

Delmar, on the other hand, carefully reviews all the talents before making his decision. He chooses the Brawler talent because it enhances unarmed combat and he wants Dmitri to fight with his fists. He also wants to protect his allies, so he picks the Knight talent. Finally, he wants Dmitri to be highly mobile, so he chooses the Traceur talent.

## ANCESTRY

Choose an ancestry. See p. 68 for the full list of ancestries.

Your beacon's ancestry describes their heritage or species. Ancestry determines a beacon's SIZE and gives access to a list of ancestry traits .  Whenever your character goes on a quest, they can choose to equip one of their ancestry traits.

Ancestries can also be used as collections of common traits, rather than literal descriptions of how characters look or act. For example, the avian ancestry allows for flight, but an avian character doesn't have to be a literal bird-person; maybe they're a human that comes from a culture where jetpacks are common.

Example: The elves in Shawn's favorite stories are known for being magically gifted, so she plans on making Dhalia an elf. She reads the elf ancestry traits and likes the Elven Accuracy one. She doesn't need to pick a trait until Dhalia goes on a quest, but she knows she'll probably use Elven Accuracy.

## CLASS

At level 1, choose 1 rank in any class. See p. 84 for the full list of available classes.

Classes represent specialized approaches to combat, like a Thunderclaw's electrical fighting style or a Phoenix's burning spells. Classes unlock equipment and abilities that beacons can equip for quests.

Each class has three ranks, with each rank unlocking additional equipment and abilities.

As they level up, beacons gain ranks in multiple classes. The equipment, techniques, and jobs they unlock can be mixed and matched in a huge number of combinations.

## Job

Each class also provides a job unique to that class. Jobs provide the starting values for a beacon's attributes (p. 14) and their equipment slots (p. 16). A class's job is unlocked upon reaching rank 1 in that class.

Every job also has a limit break - a powerful, scene-changing ability unique to that class. Your beacon can only perform one limit break per quest. If you use a limit break from one job and later change jobs within the same quest, you don't get to use the new job's limit break - you've already used your one limit break for that quest. Beacons regain the ability to use a limit break after a Long Rest (p. 61).

Example: Shawn picks the Equinox class for Dhalia, gaining the Equinox job and unlocking the rank 1 Exobomb and Scar spells. She likes that the class focuses on long-distance spell attacks, as well as the description mentioning sun aether, which connects to her background skill 'Disciple of the Sun' .

## BASIC EQUIPMENT AND TECHNIQUES

All beacons have access to a wide array of weapons , support items , skills , and spells that they can equip right from the very beginning. They aren't limited to equipping only abilities from their current job.

You can find this standard gear in Chapter 9: Basic Equipment and Techniques (p. 216). You don't need to choose any until you're ready to go on a quest, but you might want to look at them now to get a feel for what's available.

## APPEARANCE

The last step in creating your beacon is deciding their appearance - what they, their equipment, and their abilities look like. It's totally up to you - you can describe them any way you want, regardless of the art and flavor text in this book.

2: anatomy of a Beacon

BuildinG BeaconS

runninG tHe Game aPPendiceS

<!-- image -->

The only limitation is that your description can't grant mechanical benefits in combat play. You can't give your character see-through skin and argue they should always be invisible. Beyond that restriction, describe whatever you want: Give your beacon wings that let them fly around during narrative play. Let them move around the world in a wheelchair. Have them wield weapons made of solid ice. Describe a photon axe as a greatsword.

Describe the character you see yourself playing. The information in this book is just intended to provide inspiration - it isn't absolute truth. There are infinite worlds in which your story can take place. Anything is possible.

Example: Shawn finishes character creation by deciding that Dhalia is a pale elf with long dark hair and golden eyes. Her spells flash with bright light when used, their color and luminosity changing depending on her emotions. With that, she's ready to begin playing!

## LEVELS

Each beacon has a character level , which represents their overall growth and strength.

Whenever you finish a quest, whether you were successful or not, your beacon gains another character level. This is called leveling up. The maximum character level for beacons is 12.

## LEVELING UP

Whenever your beacon gains a character level, they gain:

- Ø 1 rank in a new or existing class
- Ø 1 ability point
- Ø 1 background skill point
- Ø 1 talent rank or a new rank 1 talent

## GRIT

GRIT represents the combat experience that beacons gain when they increase their character level.

Starting at character level 2 and then at every second level after that (i.e., levels 4, 6, 8, etc.), beacons gain +1 GRIT . GRIT is a passive bonus that applies to several other attributes. Each point of GRIT provides the following:

- Ø +1 HP
- Ø +1 SAVE TARGET
- Ø +1 to all attack rolls
- Ø +1 MEMORY

## CHANGING CHOICES

Whenever your beacon gains a level, you may do one or both of the following:

- Ø Reassign any number of ranks from one talent to another.
- Ø Reassign any number of ranks from one class to another.

## ATTRIBUTES

In addition to their talents, background skills, and so on, beacons have several attributes that are used in combat play. They are determined by a character's level, job, ancestry, talents, ability scores, and equipped gear and techniques.

## SIZE

SIZE determines how many spaces a character (or object) takes up on a grid and how they interact with cover. Chapter 5: Combat Play (p. 41) covers how this works in greater detail. In an abstract sense, SIZE represents how much space or control a character exerts on the battlefield; it does not indicate exactly how tall or how heavy they are.

SIZE 1/2 and SIZE 1 characters both occupy 1 space, SIZE 2 characters occupy an area of 2 x 2 spaces, and SIZE 3 characters occupy an area of 3 x 3 spaces.

<!-- image -->

Beacons can be anywhere between SIZE 1/2 and SIZE 3 . This is determined by their ancestry.

## SCOPE

SCOPE is the maximum number of grid spaces within which a character can detect HIDDEN characters, attack with spells, and use certain other abilities.

## ARMOR

ARMOR reduces incoming damage by an amount equal to its value. ARMOR does not affect Discord, which is a nonstandard damage type, or Stress, which is not considered damage.

Characters cannot have more than 4 ARMOR .

## SAVE TARGET

When one character forces another to make a save, the character making the save must equal or exceed the initiating character's SAVE TARGET to succeed.

## HP AND WOUNDS

Every character has a pool of hit points ( HP ). Points are subtracted from this pool when they take damage.

Characters have a BLOODIED value , which is half of their maximum HP (rounded up). When a character's current HP is equal to or less than their BLOODIED value, they are considered BLOODIED (p. 63).

When a character reaches 0 HP , they take a Wound . When they take a Wound, their player resets their HP , carrying over any excess damage, and makes a wound roll to see what additional penalties they suffer. Beacons are taken out of a fight when they accumulate 4 Wounds . This is known as their WOUND CAP .

See Chapter 5: Combat Play (p. 41) for additional information on HP, and Wounds and Overstress (p. 60) for more information about Wounds.

## RECOVERIES

Each beacon has a pool of RECOVERIES , which represent the resources they have available to heal themselves and repair their equipment. They can heal themselves by spending RECOVERIES using the REFRESH action and other abilities.

Beacons start with a maximum number of RECOVERIES determined by their job, which increases with BULK . They refresh their pool of recoveries when they take a Long Rest (p. 61).

## DODGE

DODGE represents how hard it is for attacks to hit a character. To hit a target, the result of the attack roll must equal or exceed the target's DODGE .

## SPEED

SPEED is how fast a character can move. When a character takes a standard movement during their turn, they can move a number of spaces equal to their SPEED (p. 54).

## STRESS CAP AND OVERSTRESS

Stress is a special type of harm that characters can take (p. 58). Stress is accumulated through mental and physical strain, like suffering psychic attacks or performing tiring combat maneuvers.

When a character takes Stress, it accumulates until it exceeds their STRESS CAP . If a character goes over their STRESS CAP , they take an Overstress. Their player resets their Stress, carrying over any excess Stress; and make an overstress roll to see what additional penalties they suffer. Beacons are taken out of a fight when they accumulate 4 Overstresses , which is known as their OVERSTRESS CAP .

Characters have a BREAKING point , which is half of their STRESS CAP (rounded up). When a character's current Stress is equal to or higher than their BREAKING point, they are considered BREAKING .

See Wounds and Overstress (p. 60) for additional information.

## MEMORY

A character's MEMORY limits the maximum number of techniques they can equip. Each technique has its own MEMORY cost - the combined value of all of equipped techniques cannot exceed the character's MEMORY .

## AETHERIC DEFENSE (A-DEF)

AETHERIC DEFENSE ( A-DEF ) is how hard a character is to hit with Aetheric attacks. Aetheric attacks target the aether that makes up a being, and they can't be avoided like normal attacks. These attacks - magical attacks from abilities with the Aetheric tag - must equal or exceed the target's A-DEF to hit.

## MANA POINTS (MP)

Mana points (MP) are a pool of magical energy that can be spent to use certain abilities. To use one of these abilities, a character must have the indicated amount of MP available, and it is spent once the ability is activated. Beacons can restore MP in combat with the REFRESH action.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## ABILITIES

Beacons use a wide variety of abilities to achieve victory in combat scenes. Abilities include traits, equipment, talents, and techniques. In general, anything that can be used in a combat scene is considered an ability.

## Stacking Abilities

Each character can only benefit from one instance of any given ability or effect at a time. Put another way, subsequent instances of abilities and effects don't stack on top of themselves.

For example, the Sniper talent's rank 2 ability, ZERO IN , gives +1 on ranged attacks every time you miss, and stacks until you finally hit with a ranged attack. Conversely, the SHOCKING GRASP spell, which prevents targets from performing reactions until the end of their next turn when they're hit, wouldn't extend its effect across additional turns if they were hit by SHOCKING GRASP again before the original effect expired.

## TRAITS

Traits are abilities that reinforce a beacon's identity and playstyle. Traits come from a beacon's ancestry (p. 13) and equipped job (p. 13).

Traits can provide either passive benefits or effects that need to be activated. Some traits provide additional abilities, like the Riftblade job's special RIFTCUTTER weapon. Beacons' equipped traits are always available and cannot be destroyed.

## EQUIPMENT

Equipment is the weapons, armor, and tools that a beacon chooses to bring on a quest, and it has a significant impact on their combat performance. Equipment is broken down into two categories: weapons and support items . Equipment is usually selected when preparing for a quest.

## Equipment Slots

Each job provides a different number of weapon slots and support slots .  These determine how many weapons and support items the beacon can equip. Weapons can only be equipped in weapon slots, and support items can only be equipped in support slots. Each slot is also suitable for equipment of a certain size LIGHT , MAIN , or HEAVY - or smaller.

## Equipment Size

Like equipment slots, weapons and support items come in three sizes , from smallest to largest: LIGHT , MAIN , and HEAVY .

You can only equip a weapon or support item into a slot if the equipment is the same size as the slot or smaller. For example, if you have a MAIN weapon slot, you can equip either a MAIN or a LIGHT weapon to it.

## Free Equipment

Some equipment can be equipped for free . Free equipment doesn't take up a slot when equipped; however, only one copy of each piece of equipment can be equipped for free at a time. You can't have multiple free versions of the same equipment. You can have multiple different pieces of equipment equipped for free, though, and something equipped for free can still be equipped in other slots.

## Weapons

Weapons are the primary way that beacons attack their foes. Weapons can be either melee weapons or ranged weapons . Melee weapons make melee attacks, and ranged weapons make ranged attacks. See Chapter 5: Combat Play (p. 41) for additional information on how different sorts of attacks work.

## WEAPON TYPE

In addition to a size, each weapon has one of the following types :

- Ø ARTIFACT : Wands,  staves,  and  other  magical implements. Artifacts often have the Aetheric tag.
- Ø BLADE : Swords, axes, and daggers of any size. Blades are basic, balanced weapons.
- Ø BOW : Bows and crossbows. Bows are typically ranged and often have the Arcing tag, allowing them to fire over obstacles.
- Ø CLUB : Maces, warhammers, and other blunt weapons. These weapons are often Slow or Inaccurate, but hit hard. Natural weapons like claws also count as clubs.
- Ø LONGARM : Spears, javelins, and other weapons with an extended reach.
- Ø MAGITECH : Magitech weapons are any that combine technology and magic. Shardguns, which are firearms that shoot blasts of magical energy from specialized crystals, are the most common sort of magitech.

## LINKED WEAPONS

Weapon slots that have a symbol between two weapon sizes (e.g., LIGHT LIGHT ) can hold two linked weapons of the indicated sizes. These two weapons form a linked pair . When you attack with a linked weapon, you can also attack with the weapon it's linked to as part of the same action - as long as you haven't already done so as part of the same action. This second

attack is called a linked attack . Each linked pair can only trigger one linked attack per turn. You can make a linked attack even if the weapon would normally be used in a different phase. This excludes Slow attacks. Linked attacks don't benefit from bonus damage.

A weapon can only be in one linked pair at a time. Both weapons count as linked to each other. Each weapon in the linked pair counts as a separate weapon and can benefit from a separate Enchantment ; however, if one is destroyed, so is the other.

## WHAT DO LINKED WEAPONS LOOK LIKE?

Linked weapons can be interpreted a number of ways. They might be depicted as dual-wielded weapons; weapons literally connected by links; or weapons fused together, like a double-bladed sword.

## Support Items

Support items are the armor, shields, potions, and tools that beacons can equip for quests. Support items often provide defensive bonuses or utility abilities.

## TECHNIQUES

Beacons learn a wide variety of battle techniques that affect the way they approach combat. Offensive spells, unique ways of moving, and changes to one's own body are all types of techniques a beacon can equip for a quest. Techniques are broken down into two categories: spells and skills.

Techniques cost a certain amount of MEMORY to equip. A beacon's available MEMORY is determined by their equipped job, and increased by their MIND . You can only equip a technique if there is sufficient MEMORY available.

Techniques are usually equipped when preparing for a quest.

## Free Techniques

Like equipment, some techniques can be equipped for free. Free techniques don't take up any MEMORY ; however, only one copy of a given technique can be equipped for free at a time. You can't have multiple free versions of the same technique. You can have multiple different techniques equipped for free, though.

## Spells

Spells are magical abilities. Not every spell requires the caster to spend MP, but they do require the caster to be able to manipulate aether. Because of this, the SILENCED condition (p. 62) prevents characters from casting spells.

## Skills

Unlike spells, skills are abilities that don't require the user to manipulate aether. They are usually nonmagical in nature, but some do cost MP to activate, like the shapeshifter's SCOUT FORM . These skills draw their mana directly from the user's body, with no active manipulation of aether needed. Because of this, skills are unaffected by the SILENCED condition.

## RESOURCES

Beacons tend to acquire various resources during their adventures. Some resources are used for combat play only, like TEMP HP and FOCUS , while others are only used in narrative play, like GOLD and RESIDUUM . There are also supplies , that can provide benefits in both narrative and combat play.

## COMBAT RESOURCES Temporary HP

TEMPORARY HP (TEMP HP) is a separate pool of HP outside of a character's normal HP .  Whenever a character's HP is reduced by damage, points are taken from their TEMP HP first. Any remaining damage is subtracted from their HP as normal. TEMP HP can't be restored by effects that restore normal HP .

TEMP HP can come from various sources, including techniques, equipment, and other abilities. Separate instances of TEMP HP don't stack; if a character already has TEMP HP , a second source of TEMP HP would only apply if it is greater than the current amount of TEMP HP they have. For example, if a character with 2 TEMP HP uses an ability that would give them 4 TEMP HP , this new, greater source of TEMP HP replaces the first one - they end up with 4 TEMP HP , not 6 .

## Focus

FOCUS is a temporary resource gained during combat scenes. It can be spent for certain effects, like the INTERPOSE reaction . It starts at 0, and has no maximum. All FOCUS is lost at the end of each scene.

## NARRATIVE RESOURCES

## Gold

Instead of keeping track of every piece of currency your character is carrying, BEACON uses an abstract form of currency called GOLD . GOLD represents the resources and influence that are available to your beacon. The actual currency used in your Reflection might be emerald chips, paper bills, or credits, but for simplicity's sake these are all treated the same way.

Beacons are assumed to have enough resources to cover basic needs like food and housing, and they always have access to their starting and unlocked equipment. GOLD is only used for downtime activities, purchasing SUPPLIES (see below), and in narrative scenes.

In narrative scenes, GOLD is only used for purchases that are meaningful and impactful. A beacon doesn't need to spend GOLD when staying at an inn or purchasing a drink at the tavern; however, staying in the penthouse suite of the Golden Goose Casino might cost GOLD , since doing so is a luxury reserved only for the wealthy.

GOLD can be acquired through downtime activities like PURSUE PROFESSION or as a reward at the end of quests. Each beacon can have a maximum of 10 GOLD at a time.

## WHY A GOLD LIMIT?

The GOLD limit is to encourage players to spend their GOLD more often, instead of hoarding it. GMs are welcome to change the limit to better suit their game.

## Residuum

RESIDUUM is a byproduct of the destruction of magical items. It is dense in aether and can be used to modify other magical items. RESIDUUM is created with the DISENCHANT LOOT downtime activity. (p. 27).

- Ø 1 RESIDUUM : Reroll any one loot crate slot.
- Ø 2 RESIDUUM : Reroll any one loot crate slot and choose a specific type for the slot (weapon, support item, skill, or spell).
- Ø 2 RESIDUUM : Reroll any one loot crate slot. The rerolled slot will be one level rarer than the original result (Uncommon &gt; Rare &gt; Legendary).

## Supplies

Supplies are miscellaneous items that beacons can bring on quests, like a well-cooked meal from the tavern or a potion from the local alchemist. They provide temporary benefits and don't require equipment slots or MEMORY to equip. SUPPLIES can be earned as quest rewards, through narrative play, most often with the SHOP downtime activity. You can find the full list of SUPPLIES in Appendix A: Shops and Supplies (p. 346).

When preparing for a quest, your beacon can equip up to three of their available SUPPLIES . Each beacon can only bring one instance of each supply per quest. All equipped SUPPLIES are destroyed at the end of the quest, regardless of whether they were used or not.

Example: Dhalia has two sleeping bags, a titan flask, and elf cookies as her available SUPPLIES . She is preparing for a tough quest, so she wants to bring as many SUPPLIES as she can. She can only bring 3 SUPPLIES and can't bring duplicates, so she brings one sleeping bag, one titan flask, and one elf cookie.

SUPPLIES gained during the course of a quest can either be immediately equipped - exceeding the normal limit of three equipped SUPPLIES - or saved for a future quest.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Gameplay in BEACON revolves around quests. Quests are the adventures that the beacons go on, each comprising a combination of narrative and combat play.

After every quest, whether it is a success or failure, all beacons gain a character level.

Quests have the following components:

- Ø Goal: The quest's objective.
- Ø Stakes: The potential outcomes of success and failure.
- Ø Information: The things known by or available to the PCs before they begin the quest.
- Ø Rewards: The rewards, if any, that the beacons might receive upon completing the quest. Listed rewards might require succeeding in the quest, or simply completing it.

Quests progress through the following stages:

- Ø Preparation: The beacons prepare for the quest.
- Ø Quest Scenes: The quest begins and moves through a series of narrative and combat scenes that tell an overarching story.
- Ø Downtime: An opportunity to undertake downtime activities before the next quest.

Chapter 10: Game Master's Guide provides guidance for creating quests (Building Quests, p. 241).

## GOAL

The quest's goal is the thing the beacons need to do to succeed. This can include things like:

- Ø destroying the forces occupying the castle;
- Ø preventing the archmage from crashing the moon into the planet;
- Ø assassinating the leader of a faction;
- Ø rescuing a captured friend.

The players should always know the quest's goal.

## STAKES

The stakes describe the things that might happen if the quest succeeds or fails. Depending on the goal, this could include any of the following:

## Goal: Destroy the forces occupying the castle.

- Ø Success: The nearby town is safe and its people don't need to worry about extortion.
- Ø Failure: The occupying force retaliates and destroys the town.

## Goal: Prevent the archmage from crashing the moon into the planet.

- Ø Success: The moon stays where it is.
- Ø Failure: The moon crashes. Bad things follow.

## Goal: Assassinate the faction leader.

- Ø Success: The faction is weakened and likely to be destroyed or assimilated.
- Ø Failure: The faction is emboldened, gaining more followers and strengthening its position.

## Goal: Rescue a captured friend.

- Ø Success: The beacons' friend is returned safely.
- Ø Failure: The beacons' friend becomes the vessel of a parasitic psychic entity.

Each quest needs stakes, although the GM can keep them broad or vague. Either way, the players should have a good understanding of what the stakes are. The stakes can't be hidden or secret.

Depending on the actions of the players, it's possible to achieve a mixed outcome - neither an outright success nor a total failure. The GM can decide the results in cases like this. They don't need to be specified ahead of time.

## INFORMATION

Some information might be available to the players before the quest begins. This helps them prepare for the quest and understand the situation they're getting into.

Before the quest begins, the players should have an opportunity to ask questions, with the GM answering based on what they might reasonably know or can safely expect. The GM might also allow the players to perform skill checks or downtime activities to gain more information.

<!-- image -->

## REWARDS

After finishing a quest, the beacons receive rewards. Whether the quest was successful or not, beacons always receive a new character level , and a loot crate .

- Ø New character level: The beacons level up after every quest they complete. This increases their character level by one and allows them to gain a new class rank. They can either take a new class at rank 1 or go up to the next rank in a class they already have (up to a maximum of rank 3).
- Ø Loot crate: Loot crates are randomized rewards. Loot crates are an abstraction - a mechanism to assign random rewards to beacons - and they aren't always boxes of treasure. Each player receives their own loot crate containing three random pieces of equipment or techniques, one of which they get to keep. The loot they choose is added to their unlocked equipment and techniques. Players always have access to unlocked loot, just like any other piece of equipment or techniques. Each player can only receive a given piece of loot once; if a loot crate contains a piece of loot they already have, that option is rerolled. Loot crates are discussed in more detail in Chapter 10: Game Master's Guide (Loot and Rewards, p. 223).

Beacons might receive additional rewards after a request, like GOLD , SUPPLIES , or narrative benefits. These additional quest rewards might be dependent on whether the quest was successful or not. For example, the rescue of a captured prince might see the beacons awarded noble titles. Clearing out a dangerous dungeon, on the other hand, might earn each player a specific bonus piece of loot. These additional rewards are up to the GMs discretion.

## QUEST STAGES

Quests can be broken down into three stages: preparation, the quest itself, and then downtime.

## PREPARATION

When preparing for a quest, the players pick the abilities and equipment they want their beacon to have during that quest. They choose the following from their unlocked options:

- Ø A job
- Ø A trait from their chosen ancestry (p. 68)
- Ø Equipment (weapons and support items) equal to their slots
- Ø Techniques (skills and spells) equal to their MEMORY
- Ø SUPPLIES

Players always have access to all of their jobs, ancestry traits, equipment, techniques, and SUPPLIES when preparing for quests, regardless of where they are or the situation in which they find themselves.

Once everyone has prepared, the quest begins. From this moment on, they are considered to be on that quest until it is finished. They can only be on one quest at a time, although side objectives and challenges may arise along the way that weren't present when they set out.

## QUEST SCENES

Quests are composed of multiple narrative and combat scenes. Each quest typically features between one and four combat scenes, with narrative scenes sprinkled throughout.

The GM is responsible for presenting scenes to the players and stringing them together (see Chapter 7: Game Master's Guide , p. 84, for more information about building quests). While the GM might have an idea about how a scene could unfold, the actions of the players ultimately determine what happens within a scene.

The players are responsible for interacting with the scenes presented to them. Players don't get to choose what scenes take place (although they are encouraged to let the GM know if they have specific scenes they'd like to see), but they do influence what happens within a scene.

Example: The GM sets up a narrative scene where the beacons have to cross a heavily guarded bridge. They expect that the players will try to talk their way through; however, the players decide to solve the problem by building gliders and using magic to soar right over the bridge.

The GM did not expect this outcome, but the point of the scene was to see how the beacons solved the problem, not to force a social interaction. The players used an unexpected but creative solution.

## Example Quest Structure

- Ø Preparation: The beacons are presented with a quest to find a specific villain and defeat them. They prepare for the quest and set out.
- Ø Scene 1 (narrative scene): The beacons scout for the villain's lair and contend with native fauna.
- Ø Scene 2 (narrative scene): The beacons find the lair, but must navigate past the traps and guards within.
- Ø Scene 3 (combat scene): The beacons confront the villain in battle.
- Ø Scene 4 (narrative scene): The beacons flee the villain's collapsing lair.
- Ø Downtime: The beacons return to town, completing the quest and receiving their rewards. They enter a period of downtime until they begin their next quest.

<!-- image -->

## DOWNTIME

After finishing a quest, the beacons begin a period of downtime . Downtime is a type of narrative play in which the characters can pursue personal interests, explore the world, and perform downtime activities (p. 27). The GM can also decide to declare downtime during long breaks in the middle of quests.

When the beacons begin downtime, it counts as taking a Long Rest , which replenishes their HP , MP , and other attributes; allows them to change out their equipment and techniques; and more. See p. 61 for more information on resting.

Chapter 4: Narrative Play contains further information on downtime (Downtime Activities, p. 27).

<!-- image -->

Narrative play is anything that occurs outside of a combat scene, whether it be planning quests, pursuing personal objectives, disabling the traps in a ruin, or even running a tavern.

The players decide what their characters do during narrative play. If the GM believes an action is important, they can ask for a skill check to determine how well it goes.

Narrative play can involve small-scale fights and conflict, like fending off back alley robbers or overwhelming a single guard. These fights are resolved in an abstract fashion, using skill checks or narrative actions (see below) rather than tactical combat. Not every fight triggers a combat scene; combat play is reserved for important, large-scale fight scenes, like fending off a squadron of dragon riders from the deck of an airship during a thunderstorm.

NPCs don't use these narrative play rules. They don't have background skills or titles, and they don't roll dice or perform narrative actions. Instead, the GM describes what NPCs do or how they react to the things the PCs do. For example, if an NPC guard wants to capture a fleeing beacon, the guard wouldn't make a skill check. Instead, the GM would describe what the guard is trying to do and let the player describe how they attempt to avoid capture. If the beacon was in a bad situation or it was clear there would be no escape, they could instead just state that the beacon was captured. In either case, the GM makes no rolls.

## SKILL CHECKS

Skill check summary: When you make a skill check, you roll 1d20 with the following modifiers:

-  + equal to your ranks in a relevant background skill
-  +2 if you invoke your beacon's title.

When you attempt something in narrative play that has a chance of failure, the GM may call on you make a skill check to determine whether you are successful or not.

To make a skill check, you roll 1d20 . If you have a background skill that would be beneficial, you gain on the roll equal to your ranks in that background skill. Any given skill check can only benefit from one background skill. If you invoke your title , you gain +2 to the roll (see p. 11 for information on titles).

Skill checks have three potential outcomes, depending on the total of your roll and any modifiers:

- Ø Miss (9 or less)
- Ø Hit (10-19)
- Ø Crit (20+)

A miss indicates you didn't achieve the desired result. You get a lesser version of what you were hoping to achieve and there's usually a significant cost you have to pay.

Example: Dhalia wants to research whether the Scourge's latest manifestation has a weakness. The GM asks Shawn to make a skill check to find out how Dhalia's research goes. She gets a 6 on her roll, which is a miss. The GM decides that instead of finding out a weakness, she learns of an ancient enemy of the Scourge. The GM also decides that she loses track of time and misses an important meeting.

A hit indicates success, but with some sort of cost. The cost isn't as severe as it would be on a miss, but it is still present.

Example: If Dhalia's result had been a hit, the GM would tell her that she successfully found one of the Scourge's weaknesses, but lost track of time and was late to an important meeting.

A crit is a resounding success. You get what you wanted at no additional cost, or you get even more than you were hoping for at a cost.

Example: If Dhalia's result had been a crit, the GM would just tell her that she found the Scourge's weakness, with no cost.

Costs for skill checks can include injuries, taking longer than expected, losing an item, damaging a relationship, embarrassing oneself, feeling a strong emotion, or anything else the GM or players can think of.

Skill checks can only be attempted at the GM's discretion. For example, if you try to jump 30 feet straight up in the air with nothing to aid you but an average level of human strength, the GM will disallow that skill check, even if you've already rolled a 25 on your attempt. Tell the GM what you want to do, and they will let you know whether you need to roll a skill check or not.

## DIFFICULT SKILL CHECKS

The sorts of activities that prompt skill checks are inherently difficult, since if they weren't, you shouldn't be rolling dice for them in the first place. That said, the GM can add to skill checks to represent particularly tough challenges.

If the GM or players believe a challenge is exceptionally hard, difficult, or challenging, the GM can impose up to 3 on the skill check.

- Ø 1 represents a very hard challenge.
- Ø 2 represents a challenge in which numerous factors all contribute to an exceptional level of difficulty.
- Ø 3 represents a challenge that straddles the line of what should even be allowed as a skill check. Before applying this level of difficulty, think about whether this is something that should be possible for a beacon to accomplish. If it is, then go for it even if it stretches the limits of plausibility. After all, beacons are heroes that routinely do the impossible.

As a guideline, the GM usually shouldn't add more to a skill check than the tier of NPCs the beacons are currently up against (see Chapter 11: Non-Player Characters , p. 259, for information on tiers.)

## HELPING OTHERS

Beacons can assist other beacons with their skill checks. To do so, the beacon who is helping must be in the same location as the one attempting the skill check and must be able to invoke their title, and the beacon making the skill check can't have invoked their own title for that check. If these criteria are met, the assisting beacon can invoke their title on behalf of the roller.

## CHOOSING FAILURE

You can choose to automatically get a miss result on a skill check. You might do so if you find that result interesting or have a narrative reason.

## NARRATIVE ACTIONS

Skill checks work for anything a beacon might want to do in narrative play, but they are intentionally broad and generic. Narrative actions are specific types of skill checks that can also be made during narrative play and that have specific outcomes. They don't represent every possible action; instead, they are more detailed and focused variations of normal skill checks.

Narrative actions are used instead of standard skill checks when their trigger is met. Triggers are given as a bolded phrase in the action's description. This phrase is the event that takes place in the narrative to trigger the action.

When a narrative action is triggered, the player in question rolls a skill check and uses the results listed for that narrative action.

## TERMINOLOGY

The terms miss and hit might sound familiar to you. They are borrowed from Meguey and Vincent Baker's Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA) framework, first used in Apocalypse World . BEACON ' s narrative actions are designed like PbtA's 'moves' , meaning you can easily import other PbtA moves into BEACON , or even use an entirely different set of PbtA rules for narrative play.

## CONVINCE

A honeyed word, a veiled threat, or an equal exchange; all are ways of convincing a person to do something.

When you try to convince someone to do what you want, roll:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): They can't be convinced to do it.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): The GM chooses one of the following:
-  They do what you want, but only if you do something for them first.
-  They won't do it unless you give up any leverage over them.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): They do what you want.

People can't be persuaded to do things that go against their beliefs or that they think are bad ideas unless you have some kind of leverage.

## GAIN INSIGHT

What you see is not always what you get. Sometimes the situation is unclear or confusing. Take a moment to look around and dive a little deeper.

## When you quickly read a person, place, or situation, roll:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): Y ou get a bad read of things. The GM tells you either something untrue that you believe, or something true that you wish wasn't.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): Ask two of the following questions about your subject of study:
-  What recently happened or is about to happen?
-  How can I \_\_\_\_\_\_?
-  What seems strange here?
-  Who or what is in charge here?
-  What is safe or vulnerable here?
-  What is useful to me?
- Ø 20+ (Crit): As above, and you can ask one follow-up question that doesn't need to be from the list.

## GATHER INFORMATION

Hit the streets or hit the books. Information is power, and you collect it from wherever you can find it.

When you spend time gaining information about a person, place, or thing, name your general topic of inquiry and roll:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): Ask the GM one question about your topic, and they will give you an answer that you think is true. The information is either untrue, or contains true information that you wish wasn't true.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): Ask the GM one question about your topic, and they will respond truthfully.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): As above, but you can ask two questions.

The GM can ask you to come up with a different question if they think it unlikely you would be able to discover that information, or if they want that information to be discovered another way. A classic example would be a beacon trying to solve a murder mystery: Asking, 'Who is the murderer' might invalidate the quest, dampening the fun for everyone. On the other hand, the GM might allow the question, pivoting the quest from an investigation into a survival quest in which the PCs must outlast or escape the murderer!

## MAKE CONFLICT

Punch someone in the face, belittle them in front of their friends, or have a psychic showdown in their dreams. However you do it, you're in conflict with someone.

This action is for quickly handling conflict in narrative play. Not every fight is important enough to warrant moving to combat play. The benefits of this move are purposely vague to encourage the players and GM to interpret the results creatively.

When you engage in conflict with something (physical, social, or mental), roll:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): Choose two costs (see below).
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): Choose one benefit (see below) and one cost.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): Choose one:
-  You defeat them outright.
-  Choose two benefits and one cost.
-  Choose one benefit and no costs.

## BENEFITS

- Ø You wound them or drive them away.
- Ø You leave an impression of your choice on them.
- Ø You create an opportunity for your allies.
- Ø You take something from them.

## COSTS

These costs have both narrative consequences as well as associated mechanical costs (in parentheses). The GM can decide whether to apply the mechanical cost or leave it as purely narrative.

- Ø You are wounded (reduce all of your background skills by one rank until you have a chance to rest)
- Ø You put yourself or an ally in a bad position of the GM's choice (a character chosen by the GM gains +2 on their next skill check this scene).
- Ø You lose an important piece of equipment (a weapon or support item is destroyed).
- Ø You are shaken (a technique is destroyed).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## MOVE UNSEEN

Getting into a place you shouldn't be is easy for a beacon. The hard part is not getting caught.

## When you sneakily gain access to an area, describe your plan and roll:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): Y ou find yourself in a bad position.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): You get in, but getting out is harder. Choose one:
- Ø You leave something behind.
- Ø You take a problem with you.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): You get in and out without anyone noticing.

Leaving something behind can include leaving an important item or evidence of your presence. Taking a problem with you can include taking injuries, alerting the guards, or taking a prisoner.

This action abstracts a variety of story beats and actions into one. Use it when you want to quickly handle a stealth scene.

## OVERCOME

When an obstacle is in your way, go through it or around it. Jumping over a crocodile-filled moat or disabling a  sentry-bot's  control  mechanism  are  all  ways  of overcoming an obstacle.

When you try to overcome an obstacle, state what you want to accomplish. The GM will tell you the stakes (the cost you must pay to succeed). If you accept, roll:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): You don't succeed and must pay the cost.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): You can choose to either succeed and pay the cost, or fail but don't pay the cost.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): You succeed and don't pay the cost.

The stakes are a way for the GM to indicate how difficult a specific course of action is and telegraph this to the player. This also gives the player the opportunity to change their mind and think of a different approach.

For example, if the aforementioned crocodile-filled moat is particularly large, the GM could make the cost 'severe damage to one of your limbs' . The player might decide this cost is too high to pay, so they decide to think of another solution.

In the sentry-bot example, the GM could make the cost 'your tools are destroyed' . If the player decides they are comfortable with that cost, they can proceed to make the roll.

## RECALL LORE

Consult your accumulated knowledge to pull out random bits of lore and trivia, like what type of creature stands before you or the name of a specific noble.

## When you recall your knowledge or memories about a topic, ask the GM a question and roll:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): The GM gives an answer you wish wasn't true, or you wish you didn't believe. They may ask what you think the answer is before answering.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): The GM gives you a truthful answer. You can propose additional detail, but you can't invalidate the GM's answer.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): The GM gives an answer, and you can change or modify that answer as long as it remains in the spirit of the GM's original answer. The GM may ask what you think the answer is before providing theirs.

## USE MAGIC

Magic is powerful, but takes training to use safely. One small mistake can magnify a spell's undesirable effects.

When you attempt to create a magical effect, answer the following and roll:

- Ø Purpose: What should the spell do?
- Ø Boon: Pick a positive trait for the spell (fast, quiet, powerful, etc).
- Ø Bane: Pick a negative trait for the spell (explosive, draining, loud, etc).

## The boon and bane shouldn't be opposites of each other.

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): The spell fulfills its purpose, but gains the bane with no boon.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): The spell fulfills its purpose. Choose one of the following:
- Ø The spell gains its boon and its bane.
- Ø The spell avoids its bane.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): The spell fulfills its purpose and gains its boon, but no bane.

## DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES

Whenever your beacon has free time, they can perform downtime activities . There is automatically a period of downtime after the completion of a quest, but the GM can also declare downtime during a long break within a quest. A period of downtime allows each beacon to perform one downtime activity, unless the GM allows for more.

There is no specific length of time needed to perform a downtime activity, but at least a day is a good guideline. Some downtime activities are dependent on resources or other people and might not be available even if enough time exists to perform the activity.

## CREATE A RITUAL

Rituals are complex magical spells that can be customized to create whatever effects the caster wants. Due to their complicated nature, however, they are not easy to perform and can have dangerous side effects if done incorrectly.

## When you want to use magic to solve a problem, answer the following questions and roll:

- Ø What does it cost to cast the ritual?
- Ø How is the ritual performed?
- Ø What could go wrong?
- Ø 9 or less (Miss): There's a problem with the ritual, and that problem is worse than you thought. When you use the ritual, the GM describes what goes wrong.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): The ritual is more complicated than you expected. You and the GM each choose one of the following complications:
- Ø It takes longer to create the ritual than you thought. You can automatically finish it by performing this activity again in a subsequent downtime period (no roll required) and meeting all of the other conditions.
- Ø It goes wrong in the way you expected.
- Ø The cost isn't sufficient. The GM adds an additional cost that must be paid to perform the ritual.
- Ø The effects are unreliable or temporary.
- Ø The ritual is considered forbidden or taboo.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): You successfully create the ritual with no complications.

Once you've created a ritual, you can use it again without rolling if you meet the requirements and perform this downtime activity. Record your answers and the complications as the 'recipe' for the ritual.

Each downtime activity has a bolded phrase in its description, which is its trigger .  When a beacon meets the trigger for a downtime activity, they can perform that activity. Some downtime activities involve rolls, while others have automatic effects.

If a player is unsure of which downtime activity to pursue, they can explain what they want to do. The GM and other players can then try to match that beacon's activity with an existing downtime activity or create a custom activity on the fly.

## DISENCHANT LOOT

Loot can be disenchanted into RESIDUUM , a magical powder used to enhance and alter other magical items (p. 18).

## When you want to disenchant loot into residuum, choose at least one piece of loot.

The loot you select is destroyed and you gain an amount of RESIDUUM depending on the rarity of the loot:

- Ø Uncommon: 3 RESIDUUM
- Ø Rare: 4 RESIDUUM
- Ø Legendary: 5 RESIDUUM

## DUNGEON-DIVE

Dungeons and ruins are great places to find interesting gear and supplies.

## When you want to acquire loot, roll:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): It was a rough expedition. You get a loot crate, but only the Slot 1 option.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): The expedition was a success. You get a loot crate, but only the Slot 1 and Slot 2 options.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): Jackpot! You get a loot crate.

You can immediately sell or disenchant loot you get from this activity, as with the SHOP and DISENCHANT LOOT downtime activities.

## FIND ECHO

The Source is made of countless reflections, each a different reality. Because of this limitless potential, it's possible to find alternate versions of yourself in the Source, called echoes. The strongest echoes are those that are almost exact copies of yourself, with only minor differences.

Finding an echo requires meditation, slowly aligning your aether and mind with the Source. Once aligned, you receive a vision of the Source and all your echoes within. State the changes you wish to make to yourself, and the echoes will fade until only one remains. This echo has the aspects you want, and is willing to swap them with you for the versions you currently have.

## When you want to magically change your appearance, name, gender, title, ancestry, classes, or talents, find an echo.

Once you find an echo, the changes take place. This is always a willing exchange, as the process can only take place with a willing echo. One thing that can't change are your life experiences, which remain the same.

This activity can be used to fully retrain your character, or to change your character's appearance to better match your image of them. It is not intended for shenanigans like getting away with crimes by changing your appearance, and characters trying to do so will discover that they can't find any suitable echoes.

Remember, you can make some changes to your character when they level up. Specifically, you can reassign any number of ranks in one talent to another and reassign any number of ranks in a class to another class. This activity is for bigger, more encompassing changes.

## GAIN A CONTACT

Contacts are relationships that can be leveraged for benefits. They can be people with any sort of relationship to a beacon, from close friends to rivals or even mortal enemies. Whatever the relationship, a contact can get you something you want.

## When you want to find a person that can help you, name either a specific individual or a general category of person (dockworker, business executive, town guard, etc.), then roll:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): You gain the contact, but you will need to earn their trust or deepen your relationship with them before they will do anything for you.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): You gain this contact and they will perform a minor or moderate favor for you, but they will likely ask for something in return after doing so.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): You gain this contact and they will perform a minor or moderate favor for you at no cost, or a major favor for which they will expect a favor in return.

Once the roll is made, the GM should set up a brief narrative scene to roleplay how they became your contact. The GM can disallow certain characters from becoming contacts, and should indicate this before a roll is made to gain them as a contact. GMs, don't make players use the downtime activity if it is impossible succeed.

## GET SOMETHING

Beacons can easily acquire common or mundane items like food, armor, and weaponry. Some things are harder to obtain - just out of a beacon's reach, but not impossible to grasp.

## When you want to acquire something important, name what it is and roll:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): You can get it, but at great cost. You either have to give up something you don't want to lose, or do something you don't want to do for someone.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): You  can  get  it,  but  you  will  owe something to someone.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): You can get it, no strings attached. Next time you try to GET SOMETHING the same way, treat this result as a 10-19 instead.

Before you commit to performing this activity, the GM will let you know if the thing you want can't be obtained this way.

## GO SHOPPING

This downtime activity allows beacons to buy valuable items and SUPPLIES , or sell valuable items and loot for GOLD . When using it, keep in mind that beacons are always able to cover their basic needs, like food, housing, and their starting and unlocked equipment.

There are two versions of this downtime activity: Buying and Selling .

## BUYING

When you want to buy supplies or other valuable items, ask the GM for the available shops and their stock.

Buying SUPPLIES or valuable items costs GOLD .  Y ou can buy as many items as you want from the shops available. The GM determines which shops are available, what they have in stock, and their prices, either manually picking options or randomly generating them (see p. 346). The goods in stock are the same for all beacons for the rest of the downtime period. The general store is always available.

A full list of shops and their SUPPLIES can be found in Appendix A: Shops and Supplies (p. 346).

## SELLING

When you want to sell loot or other valuable items, name the items or loot and roll for each item:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): Y ou can only sell it for -1 GOLD below its base price at this time. You can try again with a future downtime activity.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): You can sell it for its base price.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): Y ou can sell it for +1 GOLD above its base price.

The GM will set a base price of 1-3 GOLD . For loot, the rarity of the loot determines its price ( Uncommon: 2 GOLD ; Rare: 4 GOLD ; Legendary: 6 GOLD ).

## WISHLISTING

When one beacon performs the SHOP downtime activity, other beacons can also do so for free. Performing this activity for free is called WISHLISTING .  When WISHLISTING , a beacon can only buy or sell one item.

| SHOPS                   | SUPPLIES                               |

## HIT THE BOOKS

Libraries, schools, and other repositories of information are valuable tools for beacons.

When you want to research or learn about something, name what you want to learn and roll:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): You can ask the GM up to two questions about your topic before they answer. One of their answers can be untrue.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): You  can  ask  the  GM  up  to  three questions about your topic before they answer. One of their answers can be untrue.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): Y ou can ask the GM up to two questions about your topic, and both answers will be true. You don't need to ask both questions at the same time.

## IMPRINT A CRYSTAL

Beacons can imprint memories of themselves onto special gems called job crystals. By focusing on a memory and weaving their aetheric field into the crystal, an imprint of that memory is made. Beacons holding a job crystal containing one of their imprints can access that memory by reweaving their aetheric field into it, overwriting certain features of themselves with the ones from the imprinted memory.

When you want to imprint a specific loadout onto a job crystal, pick any number of the following elements to imprint:

- Ø An ancestry trait
- Ø A job
- Ø Weapons
- Ø Support items
- Ø Techniques
- Ø Clothing and general appearance

In narrative play , when you have a few moments to focus, you can replace your clothing, equipment, and gear with those imprinted on the crystal.

During a Short Rest or a Long Rest , you can replace your loadout with the imprinted loadout without spending a RECOVERY . The following caveats apply:

- Ø Your current HP , MP , Stress, and RECOVERIES don't change unless the new maximums are lower than your current values, at which point they are reduced to equal the new maximum.
- Ø If any equipment or techniques have been destroyed, their loss carries over to the new loadout:
- Ø For every destroyed piece of equipment, a piece of the new loadout's equipment must be destroyed. The destroyed equipment must be of the same size, if possible. If there is nothing of matching size, something of the next largest size is destroyed instead. For example, if one of your LIGHT weapons has been destroyed, one of the new loadout's LIGHT weapons must also be destroyed. If the new loadout doesn't have any LIGHT weapons, then you have to destroy a MAIN or HEAVY weapon instead.
- Ø For every destroyed technique, a number of the new loadout's techniques must be destroyed with a MEMORY cost equal or greater than the MEMORY cost of the destroyed techniques from the old loadout.

Equipment and techniques with the Consumable or Limited tags and no charges left count as destroyed when using an imprint.

A beacon can have one imprinted crystal at a time, and crystals can be used multiple times. To be used, the loadout imprinted on a crystal must have at least one difference from your current loadout. If an imprint matches the current loadout, it can't be used.

## MAKE SOMETHING

Beacons are capable of creating incredible items, whether they be suits that can survive the crushing depths of the ocean or airship engines that can traverse a storm wall.

When you want to make something special, answer the following questions and roll:

- Ø What does it do?
- Ø Why is it special?
- Ø What is it made of?
- Ø 9 or less (Miss): Something goes wrong in the design or crafting process. The GM picks two complications (see below).
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): The object is more complicated than you expected. The GM picks one complication.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): You make it with no complications.

## COMPLICATIONS

- Ø It's expensive.
- Ø It requires a rare or unique ingredient.
- Ø It's unreliable or temporary.
- Ø It takes longer to make than you thought. You can automatically finish it by performing this activity again in a subsequent downtime period (no roll required) and meeting all of the other conditions.
- Ø You need help from \_\_\_\_\_.

Objects made using this activity are not usable in combat play. Once you've made an item, you can use this downtime activity to make the same item again without rolling as long as you have the ingredients. Record your answers as the 'recipe' for the item.

This activity is for making special items. If a beacon wants to make something simple or uncomplicated, like carving a wooden duck, they can make it with a skill check at the GM discretion, instead of using a downtime activity.

## PURSUE A PROFESSION

Pursuing a profession can be a good way to earn GOLD or obtain SUPPLIES .

Pursuing a profession has two steps, each of which is a downtime activity: Learn a Profession and Work a Profession .

## LEARN A PROFESSION

When you want to learn a new profession, pick one of the professions listed below, or create one and pick the type of business that you think would be connected to it from those listed below.

You gain a new rank 1 background skill named for that profession. This background skill can be improved like a normal background skill.

You can have a maximum of two professions at a time, after which you can take this downtime activity to replace a known profession with a new one at rank 1. When you learn a profession, you can immediately Work a Profession using that profession.

| PROFESSION     | BUSINESS                            |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| ALCHEMY        | Alchemy Shop                        |
| CARPENTRY      | Engineer or Leatherworker/ Clothier |
| COOKING        | Tavern                              |
| ENCHANTING     | Magic Shop/Dojo                     |
| ENGINEERING    | Engineer                            |
| FISHING        | Tavern                              |
| HERBALISM      | Alchemy Shop or Tavern              |
| LAPIDARY       | General Store or Engineer           |
| LEATHERWORKING | Leatherworker/Clothier              |
| MINING         | Blacksmith                          |
| SCRIBING       | Magic Shop/Dojo                     |
| SKINNING       | Leatherworker/Clothier              |
| SMITHING       | Blacksmith                          |
| TAILORING      | Leatherworker/Clothier              |

## WORK A PROFESSION

When want to use your profession to earn GOLD , roll with your profession's background skill:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): You gain 1 GOLD .
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): You gain 3 GOLD .
- Ø 20+ (Crit): You gain 5 GOLD .

You can then immediately gain one supply with a GOLD cost equal to or lower than your ranks in that profession's background skill. It must be available from the type of shop connected to your profession, but you can do this even if that shop wouldn't otherwise be available. As with the SHOP downtime activity, the GM will provide you with the available stock.

## RUN AN ORGANIZATION

Beacons often have jobs, whether running stores or leading guilds.

Running an organization has two steps, which are downtime activities: Create an Organization and Manage an Organization .

## CREATE AN ORGANIZATION

When you want to create an organization or business, answer the following:

- Ø What is the name of the organization?
- Ø What does the organization specialize in?

You create the organization. It counts as a special background skill that starts at rank 0, and can range between -3 and +3 ranks. You can't increase its ranks with normal background skill points.

When you create an organization, you can immediately Manage an Organization for that organization.

## MANAGE AN ORGANIZATION

When you want to manage an organization or business, roll with your organization skill:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): Reduce the rank of your organization skill by -2.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): Increase the rank of your organization skill by +1.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): Increase the rank of your organization skill by +2.

The organization can be used like a background skill in situations that match its specialty. Whenever you use it like this, reduce its rank by -1 after using it. If you have negative ranks in this skill, you gain equal to the negative ranks when using it.

4: narrative Play runninG tHe Game

<!-- image -->

When using the Go Shopping downtime activity, you can spend ranks from your organization skill in lieu of GOLD . Each rank spent counts as 1 GOLD , to a maximum of 3 GOLD .

You can also have your organization act on your behalf at the cost of one rank, calling on it to do things that you as an individual wouldn't be able to do.

You can spend 2 GOLD to increase the rank of your organization skill by +1.

## TAKE A BREATHER

Sometimes you just need to relax. Some people spend time reading books or enjoying nature, while others meet with friends or hit the town.

When you want to partake in an activity you enjoy or find relaxing, name what you are doing to relax and roll:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): It had the opposite effect, and you are now more stressed than you started. You and the GM each choose one of the following:
- Ø You couldn't stop thinking about \_\_\_\_\_.
- Ø You made a fool of yourself.
- Ø You overindulged, and now you're hurting.
- Ø Something went wrong.
- Ø You lost track of time and missed or forgot something.
- Ø You spent more money than you should have.
- Ø You made an enemy.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): Choose one of the following, and one from the above list:
- Ø You meet an interesting person or make a friend.
- Ø You gain an interesting or useful piece of information.
- Ø You develop a reputation of your choice.
- Ø You deepen your relationship with someone.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): You get one option from the 10-19 list with no drawbacks.

<!-- image -->

## TRAINING

Training allows beacons to improve, gain new skills, or even learn new fighting styles.

When you want to learn something new or improve an existing ability, pick one of the following to train:

- Ø A  background  skill: you  either  gain  a  new background skill at rank 1 or improve an existing skill by one rank
- Ø A class: choose any class and roll:
- Ø 9 or less (Miss): It is hard to learn anything practical about this class. Unlock a weapon, support item, or technique from the chosen class. It can only be used in the next quest.
- Ø 10-19  (Hit): You've  made  progress  in  the fundamentals  of  the  class.  Unlock  up  to  two weapons, support items, or techniques from the chosen class. They can only be used in the next quest.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): Y ou've begun to master the intricacies of the class. You can choose to equip that class's job for the next quest, and you unlock up to two weapons, support items, or techniques from the class. They can only be used in the next quest.

## SKILL CHALLENGES

Skill challenges are series of rapid skill checks. They can be used for fast-paced narrative scenes, montages, and other streamlined scenes.

Skill challenges can be split into two categories: story challenges and adversity challenges .

## STORY CHALLENGES

A rooftop chase, a journey across a pirate infested sea, and navigating a bureaucratic nightmare are all examples of potential story challenges.

Story challenges are used when an obstacle or scene is too complex to be resolved with a single skill check. A GM can declare a story challenge is required in any narrative scene.

Story challenges exist purely within narrative play. The actions they involve and their consequences have no impact on combat, unlike adversity challenges, which directly impact combat scenes.

## Story challenges are structured as follows:

Goal: The GM lays out the end goal of the challenge. It could be something like 'catch this person before they escape' or 'get to your destination safely' .

Difficulty: The GM sets the difficulty of the challenge. This determines the number of successful skill checks the players need to achieve their goal.

- Ø Simple: Successes required = number of PCs.
- Ø Moderate: Successes required = number of PCs × 1.5.
- Ø Challenging: Successes required = number of PCs × 2.

Resolution: The players take turns describing what their characters are doing in pursuit of the goal and making skill checks to determine how impactful or successful they are. Misses count as failures, and hits and crits count as successes.

If the players collectively reach three failed skill checks , they fail the challenge. They do not achieve their goal and the GM describe what happens next. For example, the target could escape, the beacons arrive too late, or they don't get the necessary backing they need.

Once every beacon has taken a turn, if they haven't yet succeeded or failed the challenge, they go again in any order. Repeat until the beacons succeed or fail the challenge.

Example: The beacons need to capture a spy who is fleeing across the city rooftops. The GM declares a standard skill challenge. They set the goal as  'capture the spy before they reach their submarine' with a simple difficulty. There are four beacons, so they need to achieve four successes before three failures.

Dhalia goes first and uses her 'Disciple of the Sun' background skill to create a magical spotlight on the spy so they're easier to track. She rolls a 14, which is a hit and the first of the four successes they need (1/4 successes).

Dmitri goes second. He wants to immediately tackle and pin the spy, but since they need three more successes to win the skill challenge, he can't do that yet since it would end the skill challenge. Instead, he throws things at the spy to slow them down with his 'Perfected Body' background skill. He rolls a 20 - another success (2/4).

Mallory is next. She decides to steal someone's horse to get ahead of the spy and cut off their escape route. She doesn't have a background skill to use. She rolls an 8, which is their first failure. Two more and they'll fail the challenge!

Barbazar sees Mallory's struggles and wants to help. Since Mallory is a small halfling and Barbazar is incredibly strong, she offers to pick Mallory up and throw her ahead. Mallory loves this idea, so Barbazar rolls with her 'Bend Bars and Lift Gates' background skill and gets an 18, their third success (3/4).

Everyone has taken a turn, so they go again. Because they're one success away from winning the challenge, everyone thinks it would be funny if Mallory were the one to catch the spy after being thrown like a missile. Mallory makes a roll with her 'Murderous Ball of Death' background skill and gets a 10, which is enough for their fourth and final success (4/4)!

The GM describes how Mallory slams into the spy, sending them both tumbling into an alley below where the rest of the beacons are able to restrain them.

## ADVERSITY CHALLENGES

Adversity challenges are special skill challenges used during quests. They can be used as the basis for whole scenes or montages of scenes within a quest, with direct implications for combat scenes. These challenges represent the obstacles the beacons encounter between combat scenes, like moving through dangerous rooms in a dungeon or sneaking past some patrolling guards to ambush a target.

In an adversity challenge, the beacons will get to their goal. Unlike story challenges, where the outcome is uncertain, adversity challenges are about how well the beacons handle their challenges.

## Adversity challenges are structured as follows:

Goal: The GM lays out the end goal for the beacons. It could be something like 'find the end of the dungeon' or 'get to the leader of the enemy army' .

Adversities: The GM describes the adversities the beacons will face. These can be people, things, or events that the beacons will need to deal with, like the traps in the dungeon or the soldiers in the enemy army. Adversities provide the PCs with guidance on how to describe their actions, letting them know what problems they should describe their character solving.

Adversity challenges can have any number of adversities, but they should ideally have at least as many the number of consequences (see below). The Adversities section (p. 38) has a list of sample adversities.

Consequences: Adversities can have consequences attached to them. Consequences are things that grant negative effects to the next combat scene if they aren't overcome. Beacons can overcome consequences as part of the resolution of the adversity challenge. The number of consequences is determined by the difficulty of the challenge:

- Ø

- Simple: half the number of PCs.

- Ø Moderate: the number of PCs.

- Ø Challenging: the number of PCs + 2.

The players should be aware of the effect of each consequence and which adversity it is associated with. Beacons aren't required to overcome all consequences, and in fact it is impossible to do so at the challenging difficulty level. Deciding which adversities to overcome and which to accept is one of the tactical decisions to be made in an adversity challenge.

A list of consequences can be found in the Consequences section (p. 38).

Resolution: In an adversity challenge, each PC makes a single skill check. To do so, they first pick an approach . The six approaches represent different ways they can approach the skill check, and offer players the option to either overcome consequences or gain benefits in the next combat scene.

After selecting an approach, you describe how your beacon is contributing to the challenge. If you want to overcome a consequence, you must specifically describe how your beacon is attempting to do so. Once you've described what you want to do, you make a skill check:

- Ø 9 or less (Miss): You fail to make any progress. You don't get to choose any benefits from your approach.
- Ø 10-19 (Hit): Y ou can select one option from the hit list for your chosen approach.
- Ø 20+ (Crit): You can select one option from either the hit list or the crit list for your chosen approach.

Once all the players have selected their approach, described their actions, and rolled their skill check, the GM describes the final resolution of the challenge and what happens next.

## Approaches

The six approaches are: Endure , Infiltrate , Prepare , Scout , Sway , and Whittle . When you choose an approach, your skill check must be something that could reasonably fall under the selected approach. For example, if you want to hold up a crumbling wall so your allies can escape, it would make sense to use ENDURE , but SWAY wouldn't make sense.

When choosing an option from an approach's hit list or crit list, you can do so either immediately or at the start of the next combat scene, after the GM describes the type of combat and deployment but before the first round of combat begins. Any unchosen options are lost once the combat scene begins, and the benefits chosen only apply to the next combat scene.

Options with the [ TEAM ] tag can only be selected once per skill challenge.

## ENDURE

Weather the storm and stand strong, enduring whatever trials come your way.

### HIT

Overcome: You  overcome a consequence.

Armorer: You repair one destroyed technique or piece of equipment.

Adrenaline: You gain resistance to Physical, Force, Astral, and Lunar until the end of the first round of combat.

In the Shadows: You start combat HIDDEN .

Surprise: You can take your first turn during PHASE BOLSTER and use any action during that phase.

Below is a list of example adversities that might appear in an adversity challenge.

For example, crossing the Duskwood Forest might involve ' dangerous fauna ' and a  ' monster infestation ' as adversities.

|   ADVERSITIES | ADVERSITIES            |
|---------------|------------------------|
|             1 | Adoring fans           |
|             2 | Ambush                 |
|             3 | Armed guards           |
|             4 | Blockade               |
|             5 | Dangerous fauna        |
|             6 | Destroyed path         |
|             7 | Extreme weather        |
|             8 | Lack of sleep          |
|             9 | Locked door            |
|            10 | Monster infestation    |
|            11 | People that need help  |
|            12 | Poisoned               |
|            13 | Political machinations |
|            14 | Rival beacons          |
|            15 | Shiny distractions     |
|            16 | Structural instability |
|            17 | Time loop              |
|            18 | Traps                  |
|            19 | Unfamiliar terrain     |
|            20 | Unfriendly locals      |

## Consequences

Below are the negative effects that you can apply as a result of the PCs failing to overcome adversities. The players should always be aware of the effects of each adversity they face.

For example, a dungeon might have 'traps' as an adversity with ' bumps and bruises ' as its consequence, or a bar crawl might have 'poisoned' as an adversity with ' unfocused ' as its consequence.

As a reminder, consequences only apply to the next combat scene.

|   CONSEQUENCES |      |   |
|----------------|------|---|
| 1 | Broken | Each PC has one of their weapons or support items of their choice destroyed.|
| 2 | Bumps and Bruises | Each PC loses a RECOVERY. |
| 3 | Captured | The GM gets to deploy one of the PCs in any free space that isn't dangerous terrain . That PC is IMMOBILIZED by a set of chains, which are locked (p. 56). Once the chains are unlocked, they are no longer IMMOBILIZED . |
| 4 | Delayed | NPCs act before PCs in each phase. |
| 5 | Discovered | All PCs start the combat MARKED. |
| 6 | Drained| The SURGE level of all PCs increases by one. |
| 7 | Exhausted | All PCs are WEAKENED until cleared. |
| 8 | Frustrated | All PCs start the combat with their Stress at their BREAKING point. |
| 9 | Hurt | PCs can't have more HP than their BLOODIED value. |
| 10 | Mana-Tapped | All PCs start the combatwith 0MP. |
| 11 | Surprised | All PCs take their first turns during PHASE DELAY, and can'tperform reactions or free actions before that. |
| 12 | Unfocused | Each PC has one of their techniques of their choice destroyed. |

Example: The beacons need to destroy a corrupted crystal deposit at the bottom of a mine. The crystal is spawning monsters and weakening the ground, so the GM declares an adversity challenge. They set the goal as 'get to the bottom of the mine' and create three adversities: 'monster infestation' , 'destroyed path' , and 'unfamiliar terrain' . They decide this will be a simple challenge for four PCs, so they create two consequences: monster infestation will have the 'hurt' consequence and the destroyed path will have the 'delayed' consequence.

The GM describes the scene, explaining how the mine is old and full of dead ends (unfamiliar terrain) and damaged minecart rails (destroyed path), which are the quickest method of navigation. Monsters fill every corner of the mine, spawned from the crystal buried deep within (monster infestation).

Dhalia goes first. Because the mine is dark, she wants to illuminate it. The Scout approach is the best fit for her plan, so she makes a skill check with her 'Disciple of the Sun' background skill. She gets a 12, which is a hit. She doesn't have a good way to overcome any of the consequences so she holds onto her choice until the next combat scene.

Barbazar goes next. She wants to use a minecart to get to the bottom of the mine quickly. Because the rails are damaged, her plan is to use her incredible strength to lift and jump the minecarts across the damaged sections. She picks the Endure approach and makes a skill check with her 'Bend Bars and Lift Gates' background skill. She rolls a 14, also a hit. One of her weapons was destroyed in an earlier combat, so she picks the 'Armorer' option to immediately repair it.

Mallory wants to get rid of the monsters by hacking and slashing at them while riding past them in the minecart. She picks the Whittle approach and makes a skill check with her 'Murderous Ball of Death' background skill. She rolls a 23, which is a crit! She chooses the 'Surpass' option, overcoming the monster infestation consequence and holding her other choice until later.

The GM decides that the actions of the beacons have gained the attention of a large monster in the mine. They describe a giant monster that starts chasing the PCs down the tunnels, adding a new adversity (but no new consequences).

Dmitri wants to hold the giant monster off until they can reach the bottom of the mine. He uses the Endure approach and his 'Perfected Body' background skill to jump in the monster's mouth and keep it from biting anyone. He rolls a 17 and immediately chooses the 'Defensive' option.

Now that every PC has acted, the GM describes how the PCs soar down to the bottom cave, the giant monster stuck in the entrance, too large to enter. The guardian of the crystal materializes and the beacons enter a combat scene. Everyone that didn't already choose a hit or crit effect from their approach can do so now. Because no one overcame the 'destroyed path' consequence, all beacons will suffer the effects of the 'hurt' consequence in this combat.

This chapter contains the rules governing combat scenes. Combat scenes are tactical, rules-heavy parts of the game and the main focus of BEACON . This chapter explains how combat scenes work, and the rules and terminology used in combat play.

By default, there are two sides in every combat scene: the PCs and the NPCs. The rules in this chapter apply to PCs and NPCs, but NPCs have slight differences that are explained in Chapter 11: Non-Playable Characters (p. 259).

## SUMMARY

Combat in BEACON is composed of a few different units of time: scenes, rounds, phases, and turns.

Scenes: A scene is an entire combat, from beginning to end. Once the fighting is over, the scene ends.

Rounds: Each combat scene is made up of a number of rounds , each of which is split up into eight distinct phases . At the end of the eighth phase, the round ends and another round begins.

Turns: Each character takes one turn per round, taken during one of that round's phases. The action they want to take on their turn determines which phase they act in. On their turn, a character can perform their standard movement , one standard action , one minor action , and any number of free actions (within reason). Most NPCs only take one turn per round, but some NPCs might take multiple turns.

The players and the GM's NPCs take turns on an alternating basis, with priority going to whichever side (PC or NPC) hasn't acted most recently.

The PCs generally take the first turn in the first round of a combat scene. When multiple PCs want to take a turn at the same time, the PCs decide their order, and if an agreement can't be made, the GM will decide.

Example: In the first round of combat, two PCs and one NPC want to act during PHASE SKIRMISH . No characters have taken a turn yet, so one of the PCs gets to take the first turn. Once they've taken their turn, the NPC can take their turn, followed by the final PC.

Later that round, another PC wants to take their turn during PHASE FULL ATTACK . Normally an NPC could take their turn, but since there are no NPCs that can act during this phase, the PC takes their turn.

Phases: Phases are the various stages of the round during which characters can act. The phase in which a character takes a turn is usually decided by the action they want to perform, as each action can only be performed in a specific phase. For example, characters can only DEFEND during PHASE BOLSTER and can only GRAPPLE in PHASE BRAWL .

At the beginning of each phase, the side whose turn it is to act can nominate a character to take a turn (as long as they haven't already taken one this round). Once they've taken their turn, the other side may nominate a character, and so on.

Once all characters that want to take a turn during a given phase have done so, the next phase begins.

## THE BATTLEFIELD

Combat scenes in BEACON are played out on a battle map that uses either square or hex-shaped spaces (either is fine). The battlefield is two-dimensional - it is a flat plane, with no vertical spaces; however, there are several mechanisms to represent height advantages, like a character's SIZE and the FLYING status (p. 63).

## INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY

Information transparency is important in combat scenes. The players should always know:

- Ø The NPC types and templates for all enemies.
- Ø The locations of enemies on the map at all times, regardless of line of sight or whether they are HIDDEN or INVISIBLE .
- Ø The conditions and statuses of all enemies.
- Ø The battle plan and all relevant goals.
- Ø The locations of all Traps .
- Ø The mechanics of any abilities or items that NPCs use.

Other information is restricted unless a beacon has a specific way to access it. This includes the ability scores and attributes of NPCs and the specific features they have equipped. Certain abilities, like the LORE BOOK support item (p. 218), can provide access to restricted information.

## ENDING THE SCENE

Combat scenes end when all enemies are defeated or when the combat's objective has been achieved.

At the end of a combat scene, all effects, conditions, statuses, and combat resources ( TEMP HP , FOCUS ) go away unless explicitly stated.

## PHASES

Each round has the following phases:

| PHASE      |   |    |    |
|------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| BOLSTER    | Defend              |               | Refresh             |
| CHANNEL    | Channel             |              |              |
| SKIRMISH   | Mark                | Search              | Volley              |
| REPOSITION | Rush                |                 | Hide                |
| BRAWL      | Fight               | Shove               | Grapple             |
| RELEASE    |                     | Release             |                     |
| FULLATTACK | Full Attack         |         |         |
| DELAY      | Delay               |                |              |
| ANYPHASE   | Ready               |               |                |

## TURNS

During their turn, each character can perform one standard movement , one standard action , one minor action , and any number of free actions (within reason) in any order.

Standard movement: A movement of a number of spaces up to a character's SPEED .

Standard action: A basic action available during the current phase.

Minor action: A quick or simple action, often granted by an ability.

Free action: A special action granted by some abilities. Characters can take any number of free actions during their turn (within reason).

Certain abilities will indicate either the phase in which they can be performed or an action that must be performed to use them.

For example, a technique that can only be used in PHASE BOLSTER would say ' PHASE BOLSTER ' . One that specifically requires the DEFEND action - a basic PHASE 1 BOLSTER action - would say '1 DEFEND'.

If an ability lists an action (e.g., VOLLEY ), you use that action to activate the ability instead of the normal effects of the action. For example, the HEROIC LEAP skill requires the RUSH action to activate. A beacon can use this skill when they take the RUSH action, but can't also move up to their SPEED per the normal RUSH action effects (p. 44). If an ability requires a minor action or free action , it can be performed during any phase as long as it is your turn.

If an ability lists a phase but not an action (e.g., PHASE SKIRMISH ) activating it requires you to perform it as your standard action during the indicated phase, but it doesn't count as one of that phase's basic actions ( VOLLEY, DEFEND, etc.) for the purposes of triggered effects. For example, the rank 1 Knight talent PHALANX does something when you DEFEND . Using the Aegis spell BARRIER , which has an activation of PHASE BOLSTER , would not trigger that effect, because you are not using the DEFEND action.

NPCs take their turns in a different way. Each NPC has an INITIATIVE score, and they take their turn in whatever phase matches their INITIATIVE . Unlike PCs, though, their actions aren't limited by the current phase. For example, the Ardent NPC type has INITIATIVE 1 . They always take their turn in PHASE BOLSTER , and they could use their standard action in that phase for any action, not just DEFEND or RECOVER .

Example: Dhalia wants to attack with her bow, which is a VOLLEY weapon. This requires her to use the VOLLEY action during PHASE SKIRMISH , because that phase allows the use of VOLLEY . If she has any abilities that trigger off of the use of a VOLLEY action, like the PINCER STRIKE loot skill, they also go into effect.

Later, Dhalia wants to use her MOCK skill from the Skald class. This skill requires a PHASE SKIRMISH action to use, so Dhalia can only use it during PHASE SKIRMISH . Doing so doesn't count as using a MARK , SEARCH , or VOLLEY action.

## SURGING

Each beacon can SURGE once per round. Doing so allows you to take a second turn at the cost of taking Stress. Each time you SURGE , it costs more Stress.

All beacons have a SURGE LEVEL , which starts at 0 and determines how much Stress they take from using SURGE (see below). After they SURGE , they increase their SURGE LEVEL by +1, to a maximum of 3. A beacon's SURGE level resets to 0 when they take a Long Rest.

At the beginning of a SURGE turn, before anything else happens, your beacon takes Stress based on their SURGE level.

SURGE turns count as normal turns for the purposes of effects that start or end in your next turn. When taking SURGE turns, your beacon can perform their standard movement , standard action , minor action , and free actions as normal. You can't SURGE before you've taken your first turn in a round.

|   SURGE LEVEL | STRESS COST   |
|---------------|---------------|
|             0 | 2 Stress      |
|             1 | 1d3+1 Stress  |
|             2 | 1d6+2 Stress  |
|             3 | 1d6+4 Stress  |

## ALTERNATIVE SURGE RULES

SURGE is a powerful tool that allows PCs to change the game's action economy. Because of this, some groups may find that it doesn't suit their game for various reasons, like the potential for increased turn length or the effect it can have on one-shot games.

Here are some alternative rules you can try if your group wants to rein in the power of the default SURGE rules, although it is recommended that you try the normal rules first.

- Ø Higher starting cost: The beacons start at a higher SURGE level. For example, they might start at SURGE level 2 instead of 0. This simple change is often used for one-shot games.
- Ø Partial Surge: When beacons SURGE , they get either a standard action, a standard movement, or a minor action, instead of all three. All other rules remain the same.
- Ø Restricted Surge. PCs can only SURGE once per scene, with a flat cost of 1d6+1 Stress. The human ancestry's Adrenaline trait instead grants resistance to Stress from SURGE, and the Rimeguard's ABSOLUTE ZERO limit break clears their own Stress and that of all allies in the scene and grants the affected characters resistance to all Stress for the rest of the scene.

## ACTIONS

There are four types of actions characters can take: standard actions , reactions , minor actions , and free actions .

Some abilities grant characters additional options when they use an action. For example, a beacon with the Rank 3 Brawler talent SUBMISSION gains a unique CHANNEL action. When they CHANNEL , they can choose to use the effects of SUBMISSION instead of one of their other CHANNEL abilities.

Certain conditions, like STUNNED , limit the actions that a character can take.

## SIMULTANEOUS ACTIONS

When multiple actions or effects would affect a character at the same time, such as at the beginning of their turn, the following rules apply:

## Actions and effects from other characters apply first:

- Ø Roll checks and saves first.
- Ø If there are multiple effects from one character, they choose the order in which they happen.
- Ø If there are effects from multiple characters, the GM decides the order.

## Self-imposed actions and effects apply second:

- Ø Roll checks and saves first.
- Ø You determine the order.

Example: An enemy Cleaver is starting their turn adjacent to Dmitri, who is using the Warden job. Two effects are triggering at the start of the Cleaver's turn. The Cleaver's WHIRLWIND skill ends one of its benefits, and the Warden trait GRASPING VINES allows Dmitri to apply a negative effect to the Cleaver. Dmitri's effect will apply first, and the Cleaver's selfimposed effect will apply second.

If Dhalia had an effect that was also triggering at the start of the Cleaver's turn, the GM would decide whether Dmitri's or Dhalia's effect would happen first.

5: comBat Play aPPendiceS

## STANDARD ACTIONS

This section lists the standard actions that you can perform on your turn, broken down by phase.

## - Phase 1: Bolster -

## PHASE BOLSTER

## Defend

You gain FOCUS equal to your ARMOR+1D3 . Until the start of your next turn, attacks against you are made with +1 .

## Refresh

## PHASE BOLSTER

Choose one of the following:

- Ø Spend a RECOVERY to regain all HP .
- Ø Clear all Stress.
- Ø Regain all MP .

Then choose one of the following:

- Ø Reload all Reloading weapons/abilities.
- Ø Clear all Discord.
- Ø Clear a condition that wasn't caused by yourself.
- Ø Clear a condition on an adjacent ally that wasn't caused by them.

## - Phase 2: Channel -

## Channel

## PHASE CHANNEL

You begin to enact a CHANNEL ability, the effect of which you can unleash in PHASE with the RELEASE action. This is the only way to trigger a channeled ability's RELEASE effect. Until you release it, you are considered to be channeling .

While channeling, if you take any damage (after ARMOR ) or Stress not caused by yourself, you must pass a BULK save against the other character's SAVE TARGET . This is called a concentration save . On a failure, you lose concentration : you stop channeling and the ability fizzles.

You can only channel one ability at a time, and you can't READY the CHANNEL action. You can stop channeling as a free action . If you don't make a standard movement this turn, you can do so when you RELEASE the ability this round.

CHANNEL abilities are considered to be used at the time this action is taken, and any costs (e.g., MP ) must be paid at that time. Their effects, including choosing targets, only happen when they're released unless the ability specifically states they happen when channeling.

## - Phase 3: Skirmish -

PHASE SKIRMISH

## Mark

A character within your SCOPE and line of sight becomes MARKED .

## Search

## PHASE SKIRMISH

Choose a character or object within SCOPE and pick one:

- Ø If they are HIDDEN , you make a contested MIND check against their AGILITY . On a success, they are no longer HIDDEN .
- Ø You learn the target's ability scores, attributes, and abilities.

## Volley

## PHASE SKIRMISH

You make one of the following attacks:

- Ø Ranged attack: Make a ranged attack with an ability against a target within the ability's RANGE . Roll 1D20+GRIT . If your result meets or exceeds the target's DODGE (or A-DEF for Aetheric attacks), it hits.
- Ø Improvised  spell  attack  ( 1  MP ) : Make  an Aetheric ranged spell attack against a character within SCOPE . Roll 1D20+GRIT . If your result meets or exceeds the target's A-DEF , they take 2 STRESS .

## - Phase 4: Reposition -

## Hide

PHASE REPOSITION

You become HIDDEN .

## Rush

PHASE REPOSITION

Choose one of the following:

- Ø You move up to your SPEED .
- Ø Until the end of the turn, you ignore ENGAGEMENT and don't provoke reactions from movement.

## Fight

## - Phase 5: Brawl -

## PHASE BRAWL

You make one of the following attacks:

- Ø Melee attack: Make a melee attack with an ability against a target within the ability's REACH . Roll 1D20+GRIT . If your result equals or exceeds the target's DODGE (or A-DEF for Aetheric attacks), it hits.
- Ø Improvised weapon attack: Make  a  melee weapon attack against an adjacent target. Roll 1D20+GRIT . If your result equals or exceeds the target's DODGE , they take 1D3 PHYSICAL .

## Grapple

You make a grapple attack:

- Ø Grapple attack: Make a melee weapon attack against an adjacent character. Roll 1D20+GRIT . If your result equals or exceeds the target's DODGE , you and the target are both GRAPPLED .

Grapple attacks can be made while you are DISARMED (p. 62).

## Shove

You make a shove attack:

- Ø Shove attack: Make a melee weapon attack against an adjacent target. Roll 1D20+GRIT .  Y ou gain +1 for every SIZE you are larger than the target, or +1 for every SIZE smaller. If your result equals or exceeds the target's DODGE , choose one of the following:
-  You push them 1 space .
-  You knock them PRONE .

Shove attacks can be made while you are DISARMED (p. 62).

## PHASE BRAWL

## PHASE BRAWL

## Release

## - Phase 6: Release -

## PHASE RELEASE

You release an ability you are channeling, causing it to take effect. This is resolved as if you were taking a turn, following the rules for alternating turns between PCs and NPCs, but doesn't count as a turn. Instead of releasing an effect, you can continue channeling it and release it during PHASE in the next round. You can't release an ability if you are SILENCED .

## IMPROVISED ATTACKS

VOLLEY and FIGHT allow characters to make improvised attacks . Improvised attacks are desperate attacks with whatever is nearby. An improvised weapon attack might use a nearby rock or even your bare hands, while an improvised spell attack might be an incredibly simple spell or a fragment of a more complex spell.

Improvised attacks allow characters to always have the ability to attack and deal damage or Stress, even if their equipped abilities get destroyed. Improvised attacks don't require any training to use, and are usually inferior to equipped abilities.

## - Phase 7: Full Attack -

## Full Attack

## PHASE FULL ATTACK

1/round , choose one of the following:

- Ø You use a Slow ability.
- Ø You perform any two of the following actions VOLLEY , FIGHT , SHOVE , or GRAPPLE . You can choose the same action twice, but not the same ability or the same linked pair of weapons.

## WHY CAN'T I USE THE SAME ABILITY/ACTION TWICE?

To encourage variety. If you could use the same weapon multiple times, you might find yourself using your best weapon twice and only using secondary options when the primary one is destroyed. This way you need to use different options, and because of that, look for interesting synergies.

## WHAT DOES ATTACKING WITH TWO DIFFERENT WEAPONS LOOK LIKE?

Rounds don't represent specific amounts of time. A round could be six seconds, minutes, or even days. This means you can describe it however you want. Maybe you wield one weapon in each hand. Maybe you swap them out. Maybe one gets stuck in your foe, and you draw another one. It's up to you, and doesn't matter mechanically.

## Delay

## - Phase 8: Delay -

## PHASE DELAY

The last chance to take an action during this round. If you wanted to take an action but the phase had already passed, you can do so in this phase.

<!-- image -->

## Ready

## ANY PHASE

You prepare your standard action at a later moment, turning it into a customizable reaction :

- Ø Select a trigger, which must be a specific action , movement , or reaction taken by any character.
- Ø Select your effect, which must be an action or minor action you can take during your current turn.
- Ø Until the start of your next turn, you can perform that readied action as a reaction when the trigger is met. If you haven't used your readied action by the start of your next turn, the action is lost. You can't use any other reactions while you have an action readied. You can forgo your readied action at any time.

## Example Readied Action

REACTION

Trigger: Any enemy moves outside of cover.

Effect: I will VOLLEY at them.

The READY action is used to set up an action for later. It can be used during any phase, but the action you set up for later is limited by the phase you are in and it must be an action you can currently take. For example, if you are DISARMED , you can't ready a VOLLEY action to attack with one of your ranged weapons, because the DISARMED condition is preventing you from making that weapon attack.

## REACTIONS

In addition to actions, you can also perform reactions . Reactions are special actions that are performed in response to specific triggers, even on other characters' turns.

You can perform one reaction per turn , but there's no limit on how many times a specific reaction can be used unless one is specified (e.g., 1/round).

Some NPCs (typically elite enemies or mini-bosses) can take more than one turn in a round. For these NPCs, reaction limits like 1/round reset at the start of each of their turns and at the start of each new round.

Each reaction has a trigger and an effect .  The trigger is the event or occurrence that needs to take place for the reaction's effect to occur. The effect is what happens when the trigger is met.

Unless otherwise noted, reactions resolve after their triggers. If a reaction's trigger is, 'when attacked,' the effect takes place after the attack has been resolved (including any damage). A reaction with a trigger of, 'when targeted,' or, 'when an attack is declared but before the roll is made,' on the other hand, goes into effect before the attack happens.

Some effects, like forced movement (p. 55), don't provoke reactions even if a reaction's trigger would be met.

These are the basic reactions available to all PCs. You can acquire additional reactions through equipped abilities.

## Counterattack FOCUS 1

## REACTION (1/ROUND)

Trigger: You are hit by an attack from a character within the REACH of one of your abilities.

Effect: You VOLLEY or FIGHT against that character with one of those abilities. Each attack roll can only be counterattacked once - multiple characters can't COUNTERATTACK in  response  to  the  same attack roll.

## Interpose FOCUS 1

## REACTION

Trigger: An ally within RANGE 3 is targeted by an attack.

Effect: You shift up to 2 spaces. If you end this movement next to the targeted ally, you can choose to become the target instead, even if you would otherwise not be a valid target. Each attack roll can only be interposed once - multiple characters can't INTERPOSE in response to the same attack roll.

## Opportunity Attack

## REACTION (1/ROUND)

Trigger: An enemy begins a movement within the Reach of one of your abilities.

Effect: You immediately VOLLEY or FIGHT against that character with one of those abilities.

## MINOR ACTIONS

You can perform one minor action during your turn. Minor actions can be used during any phase.

You can acquire minor actions through equipped abilities.

## FREE ACTIONS

Free actions can only be taken during your turn, but you can perform any number of free actions during that turn (within reason).

You can acquire free actions through equipped abilities.

## CHARACTERS AND OBJECTS

In combat, everything on the battlefield can be separated into two categories: characters and objects .

## CHARACTERS

PCs, Summons , and NPCs are all considered characters . As a general rule, characters are entities capable of taking some sort of actions, either personally or at the command of other characters.

A character's abilities are considered part of that character, not separate objects or characters (unless explicitly stated otherwise).

## Allies and Enemies

There are two sides or teams in every combat scene. The PCs are on one side and the NPC enemies are the other.

Characters in a combat can be allies or enemies of the other characters. A character friendly to you or on the same side is an ally ; a character hostile to you or on the other side is an enemy .  The same applies in reverse.

You don't count as your own ally.

## OBJECTS

An object is anything that isn't a character (or part of one). The terrain, parts of the environment, and deployed items (like Traps ) are all objects.

Only things that fit this definition count as objects in the context of the rules. While we might describe a character's sword as an object in conversational language, it does not count as one in game terms because it is part of a character. You couldn't target or affect the sword with an ability that targets objects.

## Terrain

Terrain is a specific subset of object that includes the environmental elements in a combat scene - trees, walls, rocks, and similar. Deployed objects , like Traps , are objects but don't count as terrain. Terrain is different from terrain features (p. 57), which are effects that modify terrain.

The GM determines what counts as terrain and what doesn't.

## Interactable Objects and Terrain

Some objects and terrain is interactive, meaning that characters can use actions on them for specific effects. Treasure chests , for example, require a minor action to open.

<!-- image -->

## ABILITY CHECKS AND SAVES

In combat, players make ability checks and saves instead of skill checks .

## Ability check and save summary: Roll 1d20 + indicated ability score + or .

Effects that prompt ability checks or saves indicate which ability score BULK , AGILITY , MIND , or MAGIC is used for the roll. Background skills, GRIT , and titles don't apply.

To succeed on an ability check , you need a result of 10+.

To succeed on a save , your result must equal or exceed the SAVE TARGET of the initiator, or 10 if not otherwise specified.

## TARGETING

Abilities can either affect their user or target something else on the battlefield. Targeted abilities, like attacks, can be affected by obstacles or the layout of the battlefield.

To target something with an ability or effect, the potential target must be:

- Ø within line of sight (p. 49);
- Ø within RANGE or REACH (p. 53); and
- Ø either a character, a space on the battlefield, or an object (p. 48).

You can't attack yourself unless otherwise indicated.

## LINE OF SIGHT

All abilities require a clear path to their target, known as line of sight , unless otherwise noted.

Line of sight refers to a clear line of effect to a target. Walls and other sufficiently large objects can block line of sight, while smaller objects like crates or shrubs might provide cover instead of fully blocking line of sight (p. 50). While BEACON doesn't represent or measure vertical space, the SIZE of characters and objects is used as a way to determine line of sight.

Line of sight is reciprocal. If you can draw line of sight to another character, then the second character also has line of sight to you.

Line of sight does not literally require sight. For example, a character with no eyes can still draw line of sight, and a transparent wall of force still blocks line of sight even though you can see through it.

Certain effects (like the Arcing and Homing tags) allow you to bypass the usual rules regarding line of sight. These tags not only allow you to draw line of sight in situations where you normally couldn't, but also allow for one-directional line of sight.

## Determining Line of Sight

To determine line of sight, draw a straight line from the corner of one of the spaces you occupy to a corner of one of the spaces occupied by the target. If the line crosses a piece of hard cover that is a larger SIZE than both parties, then line of sight is blocked.

Example: Y ou and your enemy are both SIZE 1 , and are on opposite sides of a SIZE 3 wall. Neither of you can draw line of sight to the other; however, if you have a weapon with the Arcing tag, you could shoot over the wall and the enemy still wouldn't have line of sight to you.

## COVER

Objects on the battlefield can provide cover. Cover imposes on attacks and can block line of sight, depending on whether it is hard cover or soft cover .

Cover is most often an object, but it can also be a zone (p. 53) or effect. Some abilities can create pieces of cover on the battlefield. These created pieces of cover count as objects.

Pieces of cover have SIZES just like PCs. A SIZE 1 piece of cover fills 1 space, a SIZE 2 piece of cover fills a 2 × 2 space, and so on. Cover can sometimes cover more spaces than its SIZE would normally indicate; for example, a tall, thin column might only occupy 1 space despite being considered SIZE 3 , or a continuous wall surrounding a castle might be SIZE 2 , but occupy all the spaces around the castle.

You can only benefit from cover if it's the same SIZE as you or larger. For example, a SIZE 2 character does not gain the benefits of cover from a SIZE 1 piece of cover.

There are two types of cover: soft cover and hard cover . Soft cover and hard cover don't combine with each other. If you would gain the benefits of both soft and hard cover, you count as having hard cover.

## Soft Cover

Soft cover grants +1 to attacks, but doesn't block line of sight.

Soft cover is either cover that partly blocks a character, or isn't strong enough to fully shield them from attacks, like smoke or thin walls.

## Hard Cover

Hard cover grants +2 to attacks and can block line of sight.

Hard cover is cover that is large or strong enough to reliably block attacks, like thick walls.

To benefit from hard cover, you must be adjacent to the source of cover. Otherwise, it only provides soft cover. Hard cover blocks line of sight.

In Figure 1: Example B , the hard cover blocking line of sight means neither character has line of sight to the other. In Example C, they've positioned themselves so they have line of sight to each other, but cover applies. Because both characters are adjacent to the cover, they both benefit from hard cover. If one character was to move away from the cover, they would instead only benefit from soft cover, while their enemy retains hard cover for remaining adjacent to it.

## Determining Cover

To determine if cover affects an attack, draw a line from the center of the space you occupy to the center of the target. If the line crosses any cover that is the same SIZE as the target or larger, your attack receives .

Abilities with the Indirect or Homing tags ignore the effects of cover. Abilities with the Arcing tag, on the other hand, don't have their line of sight blocked by cover, but are still affected by the cover provides.

<!-- image -->

## FIGURE 2:

Example A:

The soft cover does not break line of sight, but both characters gain cover.

Example B:

The cover doesn't break line of sight because it isn't larger than both characters. Neither character is adjacent to the cover, so they gain soft cover instead of hard cover.

Example C:

As with B, but the smaller character gains hard cover because they are adjacent to the cover.

## Bypassing Cover

You can ignore the effects of cover you are adjacent to, as long as you can aim over, through, or around said cover. You must be the same SIZE as or larger than the cover to aim over it. The GM has the final say on whether a character can bypass a specific piece of cover.

As a guideline, you can ignore a number of spaces of cover equal to your SIZE when aiming over, through, or around said cover.

<!-- image -->

## FIGURE 3:

Example A:

## Example B:

Example C:

The SIZE 2 character can choose to bypass the cover because they can shoot over it. They still benefit from hard cover against attacks from the SIZE 1 character.

The SIZE 2 character can ignore the cover from the corner of the hallway because they can shoot around it. They still benefit from hard cover against attacks from the SIZE 1 character.

Both characters can shoot over the pillar because they are the same SIZE as it; however, due to its length, the GM decides they can't bypass it since they can't shoot over the entire length of the pillar.

## ATTACKS

## Attack roll summary: Roll 1d20 + GRIT + or .

Attacks are attempts by characters to hit and harm something with weapons, magic, or other means. To hit your target, your result must equal or exceed their defense (either DODGE or A-DEF , depending on the type of attack).

Once an attack hits, any ' on-hit ' effects apply, with the attacker choosing the order when there are multiple such effects. Damage is the most common type of on-hit effect (p. 58), but many abilities have unique on-hit effects.

## ATTACK TYPES

Attacks can be either melee attacks or ranged attacks . They can be further categorized as weapon , spell , support or skill attacks, depending on their source.

Some abilities reference reaction attacks .  These are attacks made with a reaction , like COUNTERATTACK .

All attacks have a RANGE or REACH (or both), which indicates the maximum number of spaces within which an attack can be made. RANGE and REACH are measured from the edge of one of the attacker's spaces. At least one of the target's spaces must be within an attack's RANGE or REACH to be targeted by the attack.

See pages p. 53 for more information on RANGE and REACH .

## Melee Attacks

Melee attacks ignore cover (p. 50).

Most melee attacks have a REACH , which indicates the range of the attack. REACH is also used for certain actions like OPPORTUNITY ATTACK .

For example, the Dragon Rider's LONGINUS ability is a melee weapon .  Therefore, attacks with it are considered melee weapon attacks. It has REACH 3 , which means it can be used to attack enemies up to 3 spaces away.

<!-- image -->

This weapon gains Piercing when attacking targets at its maximum REACH .

## Ranged Attacks

Most ranged attacks have a RANGE , which indicates the range of the attack - the number of spaces within which it can be used to attack. Some ranged spell attacks list their RANGE as ' RANGE = SCOPE ' , which means that the Range is equal to the user's SCOPE .

For example, the Phoenix's IMMOLATE ability is a ranged spell attack. Therefore, attacks with it are considered ranged spell attacks. It has a RANGE equal to the user's SCOPE , and can attack targets within that range.

<!-- image -->

| Immolate VOLLEY                           |
|-------------------------------------------|
| RANGED SPELL ATTACK  1MEMORY  AETHERIC, |
| INDIRECT RANGE = SCOPE 2 DISCORD          |

On Hit: Choose one of the following:

- Ø Building Fire: If the target already has Discord , this attack deals 1D3+1 DISCORD instead of 2 .
- Ø Spontaneous Combustion: You can spend 1 MP to deal 1 DISCORD to all enemies in a BURST 1 AOE around the target.

Some ranged attacks also have a REACH , but they are still considered ranged attacks. REACH , in these cases, is used for certain actions like OPPORTUNITY ATTACK , but doesn't change the attack to a melee attack.

## ATTACKS VS. ATTACK ROLLS

An attack can be composed of either a single attack roll, or in the case of abilities that affect an area, multiple attack rolls.

When an ability refers to an attack , it means all of the attack rolls made as part of that attack.

Anything that mentions an attack roll references a single roll, even if the attack involves multiple attack rolls.

## AUTO-HIT

Certain abilities auto-hit their targets, meaning they automatically hit with no attack roll. Abilities with an auto-hit are considered attacks even though the attack roll doesn't take place. INTERPOSE can still be used against auto-hit effects.

Not every ability that deals automatic damage is an attack - only those that specifically state they auto-hit count as attacks.

## CRITICAL HITS

On a result of 20+, an attack roll is a crit . Roll all damage dice twice and take the highest result.

Critical hits do more damage than normal hits. Critical hits only affect damage rolls, not Stress or static damage (e.g., 2 PHYSICAL ).

For example, if you critically hit with an attack that deals 2D6+2 PHYSICAL , you would roll 4d6, take the highest two, and add +2. If you rolled 4, 2, 6, and 3, you would use the 4 and 6.

## REROLL TABLE

When making an attack, ability check, or save in combat , you can reroll the dice by using the Reroll Table .  T o use the table, you choose one of the listed options and reroll all dice for one roll (including or ). Each option from the table can only be chosen once per round.

You can choose to reroll a dice after rolling, but before it is resolved as a failure or a success. For example, rerolling to turn a missed attack into a hit doesn't mean that you actually missed the attack on the first try. As such, it doesn't prompt any effects that trigger on misses (like Reliable damage).

## REROLL TABLE

| Consequence | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Strain | You take 1d3 Stress.|
| Endanger | You become Marked. You can’t use this option if you are Marked. This doesn’t count as a condition that you’ve given yourself.|
|Overextend| You can only choose this option if you
are adjacent to an enemy or within
Reach of an enemy’s weapon. The
enemy can choose one of the following,
which resolves before you reroll:
- Ø They  make  an OPPORTUNITY ATTACK against you.
- Ø They deal 3 PHYSICAL to you as a reaction. |

## RANGE, REACH, AND AREA OF EFFECT

Many abilities have a RANGE or REACH , which indicates the maximum number of spaces within which it can be used. RANGE and REACH work in the same way, but some effects trigger based on one or the other, not both.

RANGE and REACH are measured from the edge of one space to another. A target must have at least one of its spaces within an ability's RANGE (or REACH ) to be targeted by the ability.

When an ability originates from a source larger than 1 space - a SIZE 2 character, for instance - the character using the ability decides which space to use as the point of origin.

For example, two adjacent characters are within 1 space of each other, which means any ability with RANGE 1 or greater could target them.

<!-- image -->

## AREA OF EFFECT

Abilities and effects with an area of effect (AOE) affect multiple targets or spaces.

Abilities and effects with an AOE affect all targets within the indicated area. This area is the AOE. When making an AOE attack, you make attack rolls against each target in the area . Damage, on the other hand, is only rolled once , and applied to every affected target.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

There are several different types of AOE, including Line (which affects all targets in a straight line) and Blast (which affects all targets within a certain radius).

If an effect lists a RANGE/REACH and an AOE, you can place the AOE's point of origin anywhere within the indicated RANGE/REACH . For example, if you have a RANGE 8, LINE 5 effect, you can draw the LINE 5 from any point within RANGE 8 and pointed in any direction.

## Zones

Zones are persistent AOEs that have ongoing effects. For example, at rank 1, the Leyline Walker talent allows a character to create BLAST 1 zones that last until the end of the combat scene. Their AOE is BLAST 1 , but because they're zones the effect is ongoing.

## Standard Areas of Effect

<!-- image -->

Blast X: Affects all targets within a radius of X spaces from the center space, including the center space . Cover and line of sight are calculated from the center space. Users can be affected by their own Blast .

<!-- image -->

## Close Blast X: As a Blast , but:

- Ø at least 1 space must be adjacent to the user
- Ø the user can't be in the area
- Ø cover and line of sight are calculated from the user.

<!-- image -->

Burst X: Affects all targets within a radius of X spaces from the edge of the spaces occupied by the target, including the target's spaces but excluding the target itself. Cover and line of sight are calculated from the edge of the spaces occupied by the target. If a Burst forms a zone , the zone moves with the target.

<!-- image -->

Line X: Affects all targets in a straight line with a length of X spaces and a width of 1 space, drawn directly away from you in any direction.

<!-- image -->

## MOVEMENT

Characters can move around the battlefield in various ways, including with their standard movement, or using special types of movement like flight and teleportation .

On your character's turn, you can use their standard movement to move a number of spaces equal to their SPEED . Certain abilities can also move characters at other times.

Most of the time, entering an adjacent space counts as moving 1 space. This is its movement cost. But some effects, like difficult terrain (p. 56), can change the movement cost required to enter a space. Moving into these spaces requires characters to spend more of their total available movement. If a character doesn't have enough movement to enter a space, they can't move into that space.

Characters can move in any direction, even diagonally, and can move into any adjacent space that isn't obstructed or impassable (see below). Movement is always made on the horizontal plane; characters can't move vertically up or down.

To be considered moving, a character must move at least 1 space. Standing up from PRONE doesn't count as movement.

Movement can be voluntary or involuntary . Voluntary movement is any movement that a character willingly takes. For example, a character taking their standard movement would consider the movement voluntary. Involuntary movement is not willingly taken by the character moving and is usually forced upon them, like forced movement (p. 55).

## LARGE CHARACTERS

Characters of SIZE 2+ occupy multiple spaces, and therefore enter more than 1 space when moving. When a SIZE 2+ character moves into multiple spaces with different movement costs, use the highest cost. For example, a SIZE 2 orc occupies a 2 × 2 space on the battlefield. They want to move forward 1 space, which involves moving into two new spaces. One of these spaces is difficult terrain , which costs 2 spaces of movement to enter, and the other is a normal space that costs 1. The orc would have to spend 2 spaces of movement to move forward.

## SPLITTING UP MOVEMENT

Voluntary movements can be split into any number of smaller movements punctuated by actions. Involuntary movements cannot.

For example, a character with SPEED 6 could, when performing their standard movement , move 2 spaces, take an action, and then move 4 spaces.

If you can make multiple attacks with one action, they can move in between each attack.

Example: Dmitri wants to FULL ATTACK an enemy 3 spaces away. He has SPEED 6 , so he uses his standard movement , moving 2 spaces so that he is adjacent to the enemy. His first attack is with his club, and with a lucky damage roll he defeats that enemy! He still has one more attack he can make from the FULL ATTACK action, and 4 more spaces of movement left from his standard movement. There's another enemy 4 spaces away, so he uses the rest of his movement to get to that enemy and make his second attack.

## SPECIAL MOVEMENT

Some forms of movement, like flight , have special rules. You only benefit from these special forms of movement if an ability or effect explicitly says so.

## SHIFTING

A shift is a special movement granted by some abilities that doesn't provoke reactions and ignores ENGAGEMENT .

You can't shift if you are SLOWED or IMMOBILIZED .

## TELEPORTATION

Teleportation is a special movement in which a character instantly travels between two spaces.

Teleportation does not require line of sight, doesn't provoke reactions , and ignores ENGAGEMENT .

Teleportation counts as movement, and always counts as moving 1 space, regardless of the distance traveled. IMMOBILIZED characters can't teleport themselves, since they can't perform any movement.

If you try to teleport into a space you can't occupy, like impassable terrain or another character, the teleport fails and the action is lost.

<!-- image -->

Characters with flight have the ability to fight on the ground or in the air.

Characters with flight can can either take off, gaining the FLYING status, or land on the ground, clearing the status, as a free action once per turn. They can also choose to start combat scenes FLYING .

Flight can be continuous, like with the draken ancestry trait DRACONIC WINGS , or temporary, like with the Dragon Rider's ability DRAGON SADDLE . Abilities that say to fly a certain number of spaces mean to move that number of spaces as if under the effects of the FLYING status.

While a character is FLYING , the following effects apply :

- Ø Non-thrown  melee  attacks  from  nonFLYING characters gain +2 against them.
- Ø They can move normally over and are immune to the effects of terrain, obstructions, and terrain features, but cannot benefit from or interact with them either. When flying over objects, they are considered to have their SIZE increased by the SIZE of whatever they are flying over for the purposes of determining line of sight and cover, as if they were climbing .
- Ø They cannot benefit from cover from terrain or objects.
- Ø When attacking nonFLYING characters, they treat their target's cover from terrain and objects as one step lower (hard cover becomes soft cover, soft cover becomes no cover).
- Ø They don't trigger Traps but can still be affected by them.
- Ø They  ignore ENGAGEMENT and  don't  cause ENGAGEMENT .
- Ø They cease to be FLYING if they become PRONE .

## CLIMBING

Climbing is a special movement that allows characters to move atop objects such as terrain.

Climbing has a movement cost equal to the object's SIZE + 1 . For example, climbing onto a SIZE 1 crate costs 2 spaces worth of movement, while climbing atop a SIZE 4 wall costs 5 spaces of movement.

You cannot partially climb an object. If you can't move enough spaces to reach the top, you can't climb. Moving from the top of an object to lower ground doesn't count as climbing.

Characters standing atop objects are considered to have their SIZE increased by the SIZE of whatever they are standing on for the purposes of determining line of sight and cover.

In BEACON , climbing is just a way to move. It doesn't provide any direct offensive or defensive benefits. High ground , a special type of terrain, provides the benefits one might associate with having a height advantage. See Terrain Features (p. 57) for more information.

## SQUEEZING

Squeezing is a special movement that allows characters to fit into smaller spaces.

You can squeeze into spaces one SIZE smaller than you, but while in such a space, the cost of all movements is increased by +1.

## FORCED MOVEMENT

Forced movement is any involuntary movement that pushes , pulls , or causes a character to slide .

Each type of forced movement has its own rules:

- Ø Push: Characters and objects that are pushed move in a straight line directly away from the point of origin.
- Ø Pull: Characters and objects that are pulled are drawn in a straight line directly towards the point of origin.
- Ø Slide: Characters and objects that slide can move in any direction, chosen by the one causing the forced movement.

Forced movements do not provoke reactions and ignore ENGAGEMENT .  Y ou can't be forcibly moved into a space you can't enter. For example, if there is a space only reachable by FLYING units, a nonFLYING character can't be pushed into it, but a FLYING one could.

In some instances, you may be able to subject yourself to a push, pull, or slide effect. Even if you do so willingly, it still counts as involuntary movement.

## OBSTRUCTION

Characters and objects block movement into the spaces they occupy. This is called obstruction .

Obstructions prevent movement if they are the same SIZE as the moving character or larger.

If an obstruction is an allied character or an enemy character smaller than you, they do not count as an obstruction and you can move through their spaces; however, you can't end a movement sharing spaces with another character.

If an obstruction is an object that is smaller than you, you can climb on it at no additional movement cost.

## ENGAGEMENT

Characters gain the ENGAGED status when they are adjacent to one or more enemies. This is called ENGAGEMENT .

When you become ENGAGED with an enemy of your SIZE or larger, your movement ends and you lose any unused movement. Once ENGAGED , you can begin new movements normally. Moving adjacent to a character with who you are already ENGAGED doesn't stop your movement, since you are still ENGAGED . The movement-ending effect only occurs when ENGAGED is applied.

While ENGAGED , you receive +1 to all ranged attacks.

## DIFFICULT TERRAIN

Difficult terrain is anything that slows movement, like mud, water, or thick grass. Difficult terrain has +1 movement cost.

For example, if Dhalia has SPEED 5 , she can normally move 5 spaces. If she moves into a space of difficult terrain, it would cost 2 spaces worth of movement instead 1. She would only have 3 spaces of movement left, even though she only moved one space.

## DANGEROUS TERRAIN

Dangerous terrain is any type of terrain that can cause damage, like lava or thorns.

1/round , when you enter dangerous terrain or end your turn in it, you must make an ability check of the GM's choice. Failure: Y ou take 5 damage of any type or Stress based on the type of terrain.

For example, if the ground is covered in freezing water, the GM might decide that it triggers a BULK check and deals Lunar damage.

## ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

Environmental factors are effects that alter combat scenes, individual spaces, or even objects. Some apply to the entire combat scene, while others affect characters in smaller areas, such as in the case of a room with poor visibility.

This section lists some of the more common environmental factors. A full list of environmental factors can be found in Chapter 10: Game Master's Guide (Environmental Factors and Terrain Features, p. 223).

## LOCKS

Doors, gates, and treasure chests can all be locked, preventing them from being opened. A locked entrance - a bolted door, for instance - can't be moved through. The contents of chests and other objects that are locked can't be accessed.

To unlock something, you can make an AGILITY check as part of the action to interact with it. On a success, the lock is disabled and the object is opened.

## LOW VISIBILITY

Low visibility can represent darkness, fog, and other effects that make it hard to see. It affects how far characters can see, and makes it harder to find HIDDEN characters. Low visibility has the following effects:

- Ø Characters are INVISIBLE while HIDDEN .
- Ø SCOPE and the Range of all weapons are reduced by half. Reach and AOEs are not affected.

## UNDERWATER/ZERO-GRAVITY

Combat scenes that take place completely underwater or in zero-gravity treat all characters as FLYING . However, unless they have flight or an Aquatic Adaptation (granted by certain abilities), they can't RUSH or shift .

## ADAPTATIONS

Some abilities grant an adaptation to specific types of environments, like Aquatic Adaptation . Characters with an adaptation to an environment are immune to any of its negative effects. If it's not clear whether an effect is negative or not, the character with the adaptation can decide. Adaptations only affect the character with an adaptation. The Low Visibility environmental factor, for example, states that all characters are INVISIBLE while HIDDEN . A character with an adaptation to that environment could decide that they don't want to be INVISIBLE while HIDDEN , because that affects them directly, but they couldn't ignore the INVISIBLE status on other HIDDEN characters, because that's an effect on other characters.

## TERRAIN FEATURES

Terrain features modify spaces and terrain on the battlefield. While they generally affect single spaces, multiple terrain features can be placed next to each other to create a continuous feature. For example, you can have a single space of lava as dangerous terrain, but you could also connect multiple lava spaces to create a lava flow, all of which count as the same piece of dangerous terrain. Cover (p. 50), difficult terrain (p. 56), and dangerous terrain (p. 56) all count as terrain features. This section lists some of the most common terrain features. A full list of terrain features can be found in Chapter 10: Game Master's Guide (Environmental Factors and Terrain Features, p. 251).

## EMPTY SPACE/FREE SPACE

A free space is a space that doesn't contain any characters or objects. Empty spaces, on the other hand, are more specific than free spaces. Empty spaces are those that don't contain any characters, objects, terrain, or terrain features.

Some abilities affect free spaces, while others will affect empty spaces only.

## HIGH GROUND

High ground provides benefits that represent being at a higher elevation than other characters, similar to those received when FLYING . Characters standing on high ground gain the following benefits:

- Ø Non-thrown melee attacks against them from nonFLYING characters that aren't on high ground receive +2 .
- Ø They  neither  become ENGAGED by  nor  cause ENGAGEMENT to nonFLYING characters that aren't on high ground.
- Ø Their  attacks  gain +1 against  nonFLYING characters that aren't on high ground.

Accessing high ground sometimes requires special movement, like flying or climbing.

## IMPASSABLE TERRAIN

Impassable terrain is any terrain, like a wall or a cliff, that cannot normally be traversed except by characters who possess a type of movement that allows them to do so, like flying or climbing. Some impassable terrain cannot be entered at all (e.g., a pillar that reaches up to the ceiling or the walls of an underground dungeon).

## TRAPS

Traps are interactable objects with the Trap tag (p. 65). While many Traps are PC or NPC abilities, you can use these Traps to represent Traps already on the battlefield.

## DAMAGE TRAP

The triggering character takes 6/8/10 damage of any type, chosen when the Trap is set.

## AREA DAMAGE TRAP

When triggered, all characters in a BURST 1 AOE must make a save of the GM's choice. Failure: The target takes 6/8/10 damage of any type, chosen when the Trap is set. Success: They take 3/4/5 damage instead.

## CONDITION TRAP

The triggering character gains a condition based on the type of Trap . IMMOBILIZED , SLOWED , and BLINDED are common.

## AREA CONDITION TRAP

When triggered, all characters in a BURST 1 AOE must make a save of the GM's choice. Failure: They gain a condition, chosen when the Trap is set.

## TREASURE CHESTS

Treasure chests are objects that don't cause obstruction and that contain bonus effects for the players, chosen from the table below. Players always know the contents of chests. The GM can decide if the bonuses apply to the character that opened the chest or everyone on their team. Some bonuses provide immediate effects, while others provide delayed effects or permanent resources.

Chests can be accessed with a minor action while in their space, but might be locked (see the locked environmental feature).

## EXAMPLE CHEST REWARDS

- 1 A reroll on the next loot crate's first slot. Subsequent instances of this bonus increase the slot that can be rerolled. For example, getting this reward twice means that you can reroll either the first or second slot.
- 2 +X GOLD

## DAMAGE AND STRESS

Characters inflict harm on their enemies to wear them down and eventually defeat them. The most common sources of damage are attacks, but other abilities and effects can also inflict damage.

When you take damage, you subtract the damage taken from your current HP . For example, if you would take 5 PHYSICAL , your HP would be reduced by 5. ARMOR (p. 15) and other effects can change the amount of damage you take. When your HP reaches 0, you take a Wound (p. 60).

Stress is another type of harm separate from damage. Stress is accumulated until it exceeds your STRESS CAP , at which point you take an Overstress (p. 60).

There are five standard types of damage Physical , Force , Astral , Lunar , and Discord :

<!-- image -->

Physical: Damage from slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing weapons, and other physical sources.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Force: Damage caused by explosions and pure arcane energies.

Astral: Damage caused by heat, light, and other energy sources associated with the radiance of stars. Fire, light, and electricity are commonly associated with the Astral.

Lunar: Damage caused by cold, darkness, and other energy sources associated with the stillness of the moon. Ice, dark, and acid are commonly associated with the Lunar.

Discord: Damage that disrupts aetheric fields and puts its victims into a state of aetheric discord, like poison, burns, and blood loss, sapping the sufferer's lifeforce over time.

Physical, Force, Astral, and Lunar damage all function the same way, but certain abilities can make characters VULNERABLE , resistant , or immune to certain damage types (see facing page).

Discord has additional rules associated with it, as it has a damage over time component (see below).

## ORDER OF DAMAGE

To determine the final amount of damage dealt by any given action or effect, follow these steps in order:

- 1 Roll damage and bonus damage.
- 2 Halve bonus damage if there is more than one target.
- 3 Apply the effects of WEAKENED or VULNERABLE , where relevant.
- 4 Subtract damage equal to the target's ARMOR .
- 5 If RESISTANCE applies, halve any relevant remaining damage.
- 6 Deal the remaining damage (rounded up) to the target.

## DISCORD

Discord is a unique type of damage that deals discord damage to its victim's HP over time. It stacks with other Discord (see below) and is always Piercing .

Discord applies damage every turn. Whenever you take Discord, you immediately take Piercing Discord damage equal to the amount of Discord gained. You then make a note of the amount of Discord gained, adding it to any Discord you already have.

Make a MAGIC check at the end of each of your turns while you have Discord. Success: You clear all Discord. Failure: You take Discord damage equal to your current Discord.

Discord levels stacks. For example, if you have 2 Discord and gain another 2 Discord, you would have a total of 4 Discord.

RESISTANCE and VULNERABLE apply only to the upfront Discord you take (and, therefore, the amount of ongoing Discord you gain), not to the discord damage you take if you fail the MAGIC check to clear it.

## STRESS

<!-- image -->

Stress is a special type of harm that doesn't count  as  damage,  and  doesn't  affect  the recipient's HP .

Instead of being subtracted from your HP , Stress is accumulated. When your Stress exceeds your BREAKING point, you gain the BREAKING status (p. 63), and when it exceeds your STRESS CAP , you take an Overstress (p. 60).

Some characters (like Summons ) don't have a STRESS CAP . If these characters would take Stress , they instead take the same amount of Force .

Because Stress isn't damage, it ignores ARMOR and effects that modify damage don't modify Stress unless otherwise indicated. Taking Stress doesn't count as taking damage.

## BONUS DAMAGE

Bonus damage is additional damage added onto an existing source of damage. Bonus damage is granted by abilities and effects.

Bonus damage is only ever added to successful attacks or abilities that deal damage . It can only be Physical, Astral, Lunar, or Force damage (not Discord or Stress). Its type is the same as that of the underlying, basic damage, unless otherwise indicated. If an attack or ability normally deals multiple types of damage (e.g., Physical and Lunar), the character dealing the damage picks one for the bonus damage.

Effects with more than one target, like AOE attacks, only deal half their bonus damage to each target. Importantly, this applies only if there is more than one target, not if there could be multiple targets. If you attack with a BLAST 1 explosion but there is only one target in the area, they take the full bonus damage. If there are two targets, the bonus damage would be halved.

Linked attacks don't deal bonus damage - only the first attack in the linked pair does.

## VULNERABLE AND WEAKENED

The VULNERABLE and WEAKENED conditions affect how much damage characters take and deal. VULNERABLE characters take double damage, and WEAKENED characters deal half damage.

Modifications to damage from VULNERABLE and WEAKENED happen before ARMOR and resistances . The full rules of these conditions can be found later in this chapter (p. 62).

Example: Dhalia is currently WEAKENED and uses a spell attack that deals 4 ASTRAL . Her damage is reduced to 2 ASTRAL because of her WEAKENED condition. If her target has 1 ARMOR , they would take a total of 1 ASTRAL from Dhalia's attack.

Dmitri, on the other hand, is currently VULNERABLE to Lunar damage . He triggers a Trap that explodes and deals 4 LUNAR . Because he is VULNERABLE to that damage type, he instead takes 8 LUNAR . Dmitri then subtracts his 2 ARMOR , taking a total of 6 LUNAR .

## ARMOR, RESISTANCE, AND IMMUNITY

Armor reduces a set amount of damage, resistance halves damage, and immunity reduces damage to 0. Resistance and immunity often apply to specific types of damage.

Armor reduces incoming Physical, Astral, Lunar, and Force equal to its value. ARMOR does not reduce Stress or Discord . For example, 2 ARMOR would reduce Physical damage taken from an attack by 2.

ARMOR applies to each separate source of damage. For example, if you are hit by two attacks in a turn, ARMOR would apply to each attack.

Resistance halves any incoming damage of an indicated type, or even Stress. For example, if you would take 10 ASTRAL and have resistance to Astral , you only take 5 ASTRAL .

Immunity negates all incoming damage or Stress from whatever it is you have immunity against. For example, if you would take 4 STRESS and have Immunity to Stress , you take no Stress at all.

## OBJECT AND TERRAIN DAMAGE

Objects and pieces of terrain can take damage. By default, they have 10 HP per SIZE , 5 DODGE , and are immune to Aetheric attacks and Stress.

The GM may allow objects and terrain to be broken in smaller segments. For example, you might punch a hole through a wall instead of destroying the entire wall at once.

In some cases, the GM may allow for objects or terrain to be broken with successful a BULK check. This might be the case if you try to ram down a wooden door.

In general, the ground does not take damage. This can be ignored in certain situations, like if you want to destroy the floor in a house to fall into the basement. But in most cases, no one needs to track how much damage the ground is taking.

## WOUNDS AND OVERSTRESS

In combat, characters can receive Wounds or become Overstressed . As they accumulate Wounds and Overstresses, their combat performance weakens until they are no longer able to fight.

## Wounds

When a character reaches 0 HP , they take a Wound and make a wound roll .

When you reach 0 HP , you take a Wound and reset your HP , carrying over any excess damage. You then make a wound roll by rolling 1d6 and consulting the Wound Table to see what additional penalties you suffer.

Beacons have a WOUND CAP of 4, while NPCs usually have different WOUND CAPS (p. 260). When you have Wounds equal to your WOUND CAP , you are defeated .

## Overstressed

When a PC takes Stress in excess of their STRESS CAP , they take an Overstress . NPCs follow different rules when they exceed their STRESS CAP (p. 260).

When you take Stress , it accumulates until it exceeds your STRESS CAP . If you go over your STRESS CAP , you take an Overstress and reset your Stress, carrying over any excess Stress. If this causes you to exceed your STRESS CAP a second time, you take another Overstress. When you receive an Overstress, you also make an overstress roll by rolling 1d6 and consulting the Overstress Table to see what additional penalties you suffer.

Beacons have an OVERSTRESS CAP of 4, while NPCs usually have different OVERSTRESS CAPS (p. 260). When you have Overstresses equal to your OVERSTRESS CAP , you are defeated .

| | | | WOUND TABLE (roll 1d6 depending on current wounds remaining) |
|-|-|-|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|3|2|1|Description |
|5-6|6|-|DAZED: You are DAZED until the end of your next turn.|
|3-4|4-5|5-6| Broken Weapon: Destroy one of your weapons. Limited and Consumable equipment can only be selected if they have charges remaining. If you can’t destroy a weapon, this becomes the Broken Support Item result. If you can’t destroy a support item either, this becomes the Staggered result.|
|1-2|2-3|3-4|Broken Support Item: Destroy one of your support items. Limited and Consumable equipment can only be selected if they have charges remaining. If you can’t destroy a support item, this becomes the Broken Weapon result. If you can’t destroy a weapon either, this becomes the Staggered result.|
|-|1|1-2| Staggered: You are Slowed and Stunned until the end of your next turn.|    


## Defeat

Although defeat doesn't always mean death, defeated characters can no longer contribute to a scene.

When a character is defeated, all effects on them and that originated from them are removed, like Summons or the effects of the Hexblade's HEX . Damage, conditions, statuses, and created objects and terrain remain, including Traps .

When your beacon is defeated, you can narrate how they're defeated, whether it involves being knocked out or running away. They are then removed from play and unable to directly contribute to the scene.

NPCs are typically killed or knocked unconscious when defeated, as chosen by whoever defeated them. The GM can choose a different outcome, but they can't kill an NPC that a player wanted to keep alive unless the player gives their permission.

## RESTING

Resting allows PCs to heal, recover resources, and repair equipment.

There are two types of rests: Short Rests and Long Rests . Short Rests are quick breaks that allow beacons to patch themselves up after a fight, while Long Rests are longer and more restorative. Individual beacons can choose to skip a Short Rest, receiving none of the benefits, but they can't skip a Long Rest.

Abilities that reference a rest but don't specify what kind of rest apply to both Short and Long Rests. For example, the Shadebinder's COMPANION SHADE ability creates a friendly summoned shade on the battlefield. The shade regains all its HP during any rest, which means it regains all its HP when you take either a Short Rest or a Long Rest.

The GM determines when the beacons are able to take rests. You can't declare you are resting unless the GM allows it.

## Short Rests

During Short Rests, the beacons can spend RECOVERIES to replenish their resources.

Short Rests are taken during quests, and only require that the beacons take a few moments to catch their breath. Short Rests are often available between combat scenes. During a Short Rest, you may do the following:

- Ø Clear all Stress.
- Ø Regain all MP .
- Ø Reload all Reloading abilities.
- Ø Clear all conditions, statuses, and effects (except for BLOODIED and BREAKING , if still applicable).

You can also spend RECOVERIES for the following:

- 1 RECOVERY

Regain all HP .

- 1 RECOVERY

Repair a destroyed technique or piece of equipment.

- 1 RECOVERY

Restore maximum MP to its normal value.

- 2 RECOVERIES

Clear 1 Wound or Overstress .

- 2 RECOVERIES

Change your current job. Your HP , Stress , MP , and RECOVERIES remain at their current values unless the new job's maximum is lower, in which case they are reduced to the new maximum. If the new job doesn't have sufficient slots for your current weapons, support items, or techniques, you must unequip items and techniques until they fit.

- 4 RECOVERIES

Return a defeated character to play. The required RECOVERIES can be split between any characters participating in the Short Rest, including the defeated character. The defeated character returns to play with 3 Wounds , 3 Overstresses , full HP and MP , and no Stress . You can only bring a defeated character back into play if the player is willing.

## Long Rest

During Long Rests, the beacons fully heal, recover their resources, and repair damaged equipment and techniques.

A Long Rest is an extended period of rest and recovery that typically takes place between quests. A Long Rest must be long enough for the beacons to sleep, eat, and repair their equipment.

The beacons always benefit from a Long Rest between quests. There may be time for a Long Rest during a particularly lengthy quest, but that is for the GM to decide.

During a Long Rest, defeated beacons are brought back into play if their player wishes. Additionally, each PC may do the following:

- Ø Reset all attributes to their normal values (e.g., full HP and MP , no Stress/conditions/Wounds, etc).
- Ø Change their job, ancestry trait, equipment, and other options.
- Ø Repair all equipment and techniques.

## CONDITIONS AND STATUSES

Conditions and statuses are continuous effects that can be applied to characters. Conditions represent short-term, specific consequences that usually have finite durations and are applied by abilities, while statuses are ongoing states that are usually applied when certain conditions are met.

## CONDITIONS

Conditions are always negative. Most effects that give conditions indicate when the conditions end (e.g., 'until the end of the target's next turn'). They can also be cleared with REFRESH .

## BLINDED

BLINDED characters can only target and draw line of sight to adjacent spaces.

## DAZED

DAZED characters receive +1 on all attacks, checks, and saves.

## DISARMED

DISARMED characters can't make weapon attacks except for improvised weapon attacks.

## IMMOBILIZED

IMMOBILIZED characters can't voluntarily move, but can still be subjected to forced and involuntary movement.

## MARKED

When attacking a MARKED character, the attacker can choose to consume the MARK. Doing this clears MARKED and grants +1 on that attack roll. A character can only have one MARK at a time.

## SILENCED

SILENCED characters can't use or RELEASE spells.

## SLOWED

SLOWED characters can only move with their standard movement; they can't RUSH or use any other forms of voluntary movement.

SLOWED PCs can only take their turns in PHASE DELAY . SLOWED NPCs have their next Initiative become 8 (this lasts until they've taken that turn and the condition ends). During rounds in which they are SLOWED , Bosses must take at least one of their turns during PHASE DELAY , even if they clear the condition before doing so.

<!-- image -->

## STUNNED

STUNNED characters can perform either a standard action or a minor action on their turns, not both. Additionally, they can't FULL ATTACK or perform reactions , and their DODGE and A-DEF both count as 5.

## SUNDERED

SUNDERED characters don't benefit from ARMOR or resistance .

## VULNERABLE

VULNERABLE characters take double damage from Physical, Astral, Lunar, and Force sources. Stress and Discord are not affected.

## WEAKENED

WEAKENED characters deal half damage when dealing Physical, Force, Astral, and Lunar. Stress and Discord are not affected. Their Summons and Traps are also unaffected.

## STATUSES

Statuses describe characters' current states, and can be positive or negative. Unlike conditions, they can't be removed unless specific actions are taken or their requirements no longer apply.

## BLOODIED

Characters are BLOODIED when they have half of their HP maximum or less (their BLOODIED level).

## BREAKING

Characters are BREAKING when they have Stress equal to or exceeding half their STRESS CAP (their BREAKING point).

## ENGAGED

When a character becomes adjacent to an enemy, they both gain the ENGAGED status as long as they are adjacent to one another. ENGAGED characters make ranged attacks at +1 . If a character becomes ENGAGED by another character of the same SIZE or larger, their movement ends and they lose any unused movement. C haracters cease to be ENGAGED when they are no longer adjacent to an enemy.

## FLYING

Characters with flight can either take off, gaining the FLYING status, or land on the ground, clearing the status, as a free action once per turn. They can also choose to start combat scenes FLYING .

While a character is FLYING , the following effects apply :

- Ø Non-thrown  melee  attacks  from  nonFLYING characters gain +2 against them.
- Ø They can move normally over and are immune to the effects of terrain, obstructions, and terrain features, but cannot benefit from or interact with them either. When flying over objects, they are considered to have their SIZE increased by the SIZE of whatever they are flying over for the purposes of determining line of sight and cover, as if they were climbing .
- Ø They cannot benefit from cover from terrain or objects.
- Ø When attacking nonFLYING characters, they treat their target's cover from terrain and objects as one step lower (hard cover becomes soft cover, soft cover becomes no cover).
- Ø They  ignore ENGAGEMENT and  don't  cause ENGAGEMENT .
- Ø They don't trigger Traps but can still be affected by them.
- Ø They cease to be FLYING if they become PRONE .

## GRAPPLED

GRAPPLED always involves at least two characters, both of whom receive the status. While GRAPPLED , the following effects apply:

- Ø Both characters are ENGAGED.
- Ø Neither character can take reactions .
- Ø The larger character can move normally.
- Ø The smaller character is IMMOBILIZED , but is dragged along by the larger character when they move, mirroring their movements and inheriting any special forms of movement like flight .
- Ø If the initiator is the same SIZE as the target, they count as the larger one during the turn in which they initiate the GRAPPLE .
- Ø Characters of the same SIZE can make a contested BULK check as a free action to see if they count as the larger one until this contest is repeated.

GRAPPLED ends when one of the following occurs:

- Ø The characters are no longer adjacent to each other.
- Ø The initiator ends it as a free action .
- Ø The GRAPPLE target succeeds on a contested BULK check as a minor action .

## HIDDEN

While a character is HIDDEN , enemies can only target them with AOEs or while adjacent to them. They are still visible on the combat map to players and the GM. The following things end HIDDEN :

- Ø The HIDDEN character uses a hostile effect (e.g., attacking or forcing a save) or uses INTERPOSE .
- Ø The HIDDEN character ends any turn within an enemy's line of sight unless they are either INVISIBLE or benefiting from cover against that enemy.
- Ø An enemy performs a successful SEARCH against them.

## INVISIBLE

When making an attack against an INVISIBLE character, before any attack rolls are made, roll a d6. On a 1-3, the attack misses. INVISIBLE characters are still visible on the map to players and the GM. INVISIBLE lasts until the end of the scene unless stated otherwise.

## PRONE

Attacks against PRONE targets gain +1 and PRONE characters always count as moving through difficult terrain . Unless they are IMMOBILIZED , PRONE characters can stand instead of making their standard movement, which ends this status. Standing doesn't count as a form of movement.

## TAGS

Abilities often have tags associated with them, such as Aura 2 , Piercing , or Polymorph . When an ability has a tag, the effects of that tag apply to the effects of that ability. Some abilities don't have tags, but do have effects that have a tag, or that create objects or characters with the tag, as indicated in their description.

If an ability has a tag with a value of 'X' , like Mana X, that means the amount can vary, but must be at least 1. Below is a list of tags and their effects.

Accurate: Attacks with this tag gain +1 .

Aetheric: Attacks with this tag are made against A-DEF instead of DODGE .

Arcing: Abilities with this tag can be aimed over obstacles. They ignore line of sight as long as there is a vertical path to the target, although cover still applies.

Armor: Abilities with this tag represent suits of armor or similar defenses, many of which provide a bonus to ARMOR . A character can only have one ability with this tag equipped at a time.

Aura X: When activated, abilities with this tag affect indicated characters within X spaces of the user. A character can only have one Aura activated at a time and can change Auras 1/turn.

Auto-Hit: Attacks with this tag automatically hit without making an attack roll.

Blast X: Abilities with this tag have an AOE. It affects all targets within a radius of X spaces from the center space, including the center space . Cover and line of sight are calculated from the center space. Users can be affected by their own Blast .

Burst X: Affects all targets within a radius of X spaces from the edge of the spaces occupied by the target, including the target's spaces but excluding the target itself . Cover and line of sight are calculated from the edge of the spaces occupied by the target. If a Burst forms a zone , the zone moves with the target.

Close Blast X: Abilities with this tag have an AOE. It operates like a Blast , but:

-  at least 1 space must be adjacent to the user
-  the user can't be in the area
-  cover and line of sight are calculated from the user.

Consumable X: Abilities with this tag can only be used X times per quest. Consumable abilities represent potions, elixirs, and other items that can be replenished.

Enchantment: Abilities with this tag modify other abilities. Enchantments can typically only be applied to specific types of abilities and can only be applied to one ability at a time. Additionally, each ability can only have one Enchantment at a time. Enchantments can only be applied to a new ability while preparing for a quest or during a Long Rest . If an Enchantment is destroyed, the ability it is enchanting is not destroyed and vice versa. Traits and talents can't be enchanted.

Focus X: Abilities with this tag cost X Focus to use.

Homing: Abilities with this tag ignore line of sight and the effects of cover. As long as the target is within Range and it is possible to reach them (i.e., they aren't in a box), they can be targeted.

Inaccurate: Attacks with this tag receive +1 .

Indirect: Attacks with this tag ignore any from cover.

Innate: Abilities with this tag can't be destroyed or enchanted. They can't be chosen for destruction as the result of a wound roll.

Limited X: Abilities with this tag can only be used X times per quest. Limited abilities provide powerful effects that can't be replenished during a quest once used.

Line X: Abilities with this tag have an AOE. It affects all targets in a straight line with a length of X spaces and a width of 1 space, drawn directly away from you in any direction.

Mana X: Abilities with this tag cost X MP to use.

Piercing: Damage with this tag ignores ARMOR .

Polymorph: Abilities with this tag modify the target's form. A character can only be under the effect of one ability with this tag at a time, and any subsequent polymorph effects are automatically cancelled while they are under the effects of a polymorph.

Pull X: Abilities with this tag inflict a type of forced movement. On a hit, the target is moved X spaces directly toward the origin.

Push X: Abilities with this tag inflict a type of forced movement. On a hit, the target is moved X spaces directly away from the origin.

Range X: Abilities with this tag can be used on targets within X spaces.

Reach X: Abilities with this tag can be used on targets within X spaces. This tag also determines the range of the OPPORTUNITY ATTACK reaction.

Reliable X: Abilities with this tag always deal at least X damage, even if they would miss or deal less than X damage. Reliable damage inherits the ability's damage type and tags; however, Reliable damage does not count as a hit and doesn't trigger any effects that require a hit.

Reloading: Abilities with this tag must be reloaded after each use before they can be used again. This can be done using REFRESH and other abilities.

Slide X: Abilities with this tag inflict a type of forced movement. On a hit, the target is moved X spaces in any direction.

Slow: Abilities with this tag can only be activated as part of FULL ATTACK .

Stressful X: Abilities with this tag inflict X Stress on the user.

Summon: Abilities with this tag create one or more temporary characters under the control of another character, each of which has the Summon tag.

By default, each character can only have one Summon per ability with this tag in play at a time. If a Summon is defeated or dismissed, a new one can be made using that same ability. Summons can't create Summons.

Thrown X: Abilities with this tag can be used to make a thrown attack , a melee attack made against a target within X spaces. Thrown attacks are affected by cover. If throwing a weapon, it lands in a space adjacent to the target (thrower's choice), and must be picked up as a free action while adjacent to it before it can be used again.

Summons have the following statistics unless otherwise indicated:

- Ø SIZE 1/2
- Ø HP 5
- Ø DODGE/A-DEF 10
- Ø SPEED 0
- Ø SAVE TARGET = Summoner's SAVE TARGET
- Ø BULK / AGILITY / MIND / MAGIC 0

Summons can only be created in free spaces that they could normally enter (they can't be summoned into impassable terrain, for example).

Summons are characters with a standard action , standard movement , and minor action per round; however, they can't perform any actions unless they have an ability that lets them do so and can't perform a movement unless they have SPEED . Their turn is their summoner's turn, and if they can take actions or move, they can do so at any point in their summoner's turn.

Summons are defeated if they are reduced to 0 HP. They can also be dismissed by their summoner as a free action . Summons last until dismissed or defeated, or until the end of the scene.

Trap: Abilities with this tag place traps - objects that modify spaces - or are traps themselves. They must be placed in a free adjacent space. They become armed at the end of the turn in which they are placed. Moving into or adjacent to a space occupied by a trap triggers it, activating its effects, after which it is removed from play.

Traps are permanently HIDDEN , but can be automatically detected with SEARCH .  Y ou can attempt to disarm a trap by making an AGILITY check as a minor action when moving into or adjacent to its space (before it is triggered). On a success, the trap is removed from play without being activated. On a failure, it activates as normal.

Unbreakable: Abilities with this tag cannot be destroyed and can't be selected for destruction if there are nonUnbreakable options left. If an Unbreakable result is selected from a wound or overstress roll, it becomes a DAZED result instead.

Unique: Characters can only equip one copy of each ability with this tag at a time.

## 6: ANCESTRIES

## A character's ancestry describes their heritage or species.

Your beacon's ancestry determines their SIZE and gives you a collection of ancestry traits that you can choose from for combat scenes. You select an ancestry for your beacon during character creation (p. 13), and can only change it with the FIND ECHO downtime activity (p. 28).

In narrative play, ancestry can provide whatever abilities or powers work in your Reflection. For example, in your Reflection, elves might be immortal, while machina don't need to eat or sleep. Those are flavorful abilities that impact narrative play, but don't affect combat play unless you pick an ancestry trait that says otherwise.

Ancestry can also be used to represent cultural themes instead of biological ones, and individual ancestries can be reimagined to represent entirely different species. For example, you might choose the elemental ancestry to represent a ghostly, spectral beacon.

This chapter lists the available ancestries for players to choose. Each ancestry contains some questions you can answer to help flesh out the ancestry and your character, as well as an example of a Reflection and discussion of how that ancestry fits within it. As a reminder, one of the things common to all Reflections is the presence of a Scourge - a recurring threat unique to that Reflection (p. 230).

## DUAL AND CUSTOM ANCESTRIES

Some characters might have more than one ancestry, representing two different parts of their background, or a custom one that isn't represented by the existing options.

When playing such a character with a dual ancestry, pick one ancestry as normal; however, you might have abilities in narrative play that stem from the other ancestry.

Additionally, the GM can optionally allow you to base your character's SIZE on one ancestry and create a list of four ancestry traits (two from each ancestry) as your pool of potential ancestry abilities.

Example: Artemis is the child of a halfling and a goblin. She is SIZE 1/2 since both of her parent ancestries are SIZE 1/2 ,  and her player chooses two ancestry traits from each. She chooses NIMBLE ESCAPE and BITE for the goblin heritage, and LUCKY and BRAVE for her halfling heritage. Now, whenever she prepares for a quest, she can choose one of those four ancestry traits.

To create a custom ancestry, start by choosing a SIZE between 1/2 and 3 .  Then, create a pool of any four existing ancestry traits. It is recommended that you choose traits that fit the themes of your custom ancestry, rather than just choosing the abilities you think are strongest.

## ANCESTRIES IN YOUR REFLECTION

Not every ancestry exists in every Reflection. Some Reflections only feature humans, while others have a limited number of ancestries represented.

Just because an ancestry doesn't exist in a setting, doesn't mean you can't use its traits. In an all-human setting, for example, there are huge variances between people. Maybe your human with the goblin ancestry is a small teen, or a group of kids in a trench coat (using the SWARM trait). A human with the avian ancestry might have a magic item that allows them to fly, or could have built a jetpack.

At heart, an ancestry is a set of bonuses for combat play and an important part of the game. Just because there isn't a species in the setting that matches the ancestry, doesn't mean it shouldn't be used. BEACON is a game about choices, and severely restricting the ancestry choices takes away a vital part of combat play.

## In summary:

- Ø ancestry does not have to equal species
- Ø ancestry and ancestry traits only have direct rules effects in combat play
- Ø players shouldn't be overly restricted in choosing ancestries
- Ø your Reflection can have as many or as few ancestries as you want.

Avians are birdlike people with the physical characteristics of flying creatures: ravens, parrots, bats, and so on. Not every avian can fly, however, and some are completely wingless.

- Ø Where do your people live and in what kind of environment?
- Ø What do your people eat, and what do they consider a delicacy?
- Ø Are avians without wings or the ability to fly treated differently than those that have them?

## EXAMPLE REFLECTION: GARUDA

Name: Celestos

The celestos of Garuda live atop the highest mountains, where they are bathed in radiant energy from the sky. As a result, they have learned to harness this energy as holy magic.

Celestos place a great emphasis on wings. Those born with additional sets of wings are seen as having great potential. Most celestos have two wings, with four wings being rare and six or more wings almost unheard of.

Some celestos are born with a mutation that causes them to grow an additional pair of arms, but no wings. These celestos find life atop the mountains hard, as their homes aren't designed for the flightless. They usually leave their homes to find a more suitable life among the other flightless civilizations, or take up supportive roles in their homelands.

## FLIGHTLESS CELESTOS

If you want to play a flightless celestos, you can either use the orc ancestry or switch out the avian Flight trait with a trait from the orc ancestry.

## Flock Tactics

## EXAMPLE REFLECTION: DIABLOS

Name: Azin

The azin of Diablos are just one of the many peoples that live on the Umbral Plane, but some of the few who can easily cross into the Astral Plane.

Most azin will only guide travelers between the planes with a strong contract in place, a practice learned from a hard lesson long ago.

Azin mercenaries, guards, and scouts are highly sought after for their unfamiliar umbral powers, which seem strange and frightening to those native to the Astral Plane.

- Ø What monument or structure of your people has endured multiple disasters?

## EXAMPLE REFLECTION: IO

## Name: Drakhal

The drakhal of Io primarily dwell in volcanic regions, which run the gamut from barren wastelands to tropical islands teeming with life.

Each group of drakhal are in possession of ancient dragon eggs. These massive eggs must be incubated in the burning temperatures of active volcanos. Each group of drakhal believe they are the inheritors of their specific dragon's legacy, which explains the physical differences between these groups: some have tails, some have wings, some have few scales, and so on.

Inside their eggs, the growing dragons are already named, with names like Bahamut, Phoenix, and Nidhogg. The drakhal believe that when their dragon hatches, it will change the world in their favor. One dragon might destroy all enemies of the drakhal that hatched it, while another might bring prosperity and bountiful harvests across the world. Once the dragon has changed the world, it returns to its lair, where a new shell forms around it, and it waits until its next hatching.

These ancient dragons rarely awaken, and each has their own cycle. It is likely, due to the cyclical nature of these dragons, that one (or more) of them is Io's Scourge .

## EXAMPLE REFLECTION: PENUMBRA

## Name: Tektite

The tektite of Penumbra are locked in a constant race upward, fleeing the ever-encroaching darkness from below.

There is no surface in this Reflection, or at least none has been discovered. The sky is stone, and it never ends. The tektite and other people of Penumbra live comfortably in whatever caverns they carve out, exploring and meeting each other through tunnels both natural and cut by unknown forces.

Danger lurks in the depths, beneath old tunnels long abandoned. Creatures of chaos live there, surging their way upward. Every civilization moves ever higher, trying to stay ahead of the Scourge Beneath .  The tektite have excelled at this, moving upward while maintaining strongholds to hold back the Scourge, but no matter what they do, the darkness always advances …

## EXAMPLE REFLECTION: CONVERGENCE Name: Fewa

The fewa of Convergence live in separate nations based on their associated elements. Two important individuals are always born or created within a few years of each other: the Weaver and the Cultivator .

The Weaver can always manipulate multiple elements. They seek to unify the fewa nations under one banner and one element.

The Cultivator seeks to keep the nations independent, and to grow them individually.

The Weaver and Cultivator are always in conflict with each other, as their purposes and philosophies are opposed. Each approach has benefits and flaws, and each party firmly believes in their role.

To complicate matters, in each cycle one of these two people becomes the Scourge , and there appears to be no pattern as to which one it is.

## REFLECTION: MOONTOUCHED

## Name: Qiradel

The qiradel of Moontouched hail from a distant planet called Fey which was destroyed and shattered by a great cataclysm a generation ago. The inhabitants fled through teleportation magics and flying cities, hurling themselves through space in the hope of finding safety.

Over the last 100 years, many of these qiradel came to a planet populated by powerful civilizations, with abundant magical energy and a moon in an uneven orbit. There have been many painful lessons when adapting to life on this new planet, but some measure of stability has finally been found.

The qiradel of this Reflection absorb magical energy into their bodies throughout their lives, gaining physical characteristics based on the types of magic they encounter. Qiradel who surround themselves with primal magic might grow leafy tattoos, while those with boundless arcane magic might gain glowing eyes. Divine magic, a source of aether drawn directly from

## EXAMPLE REFLECTION: TITAN

## Name: Jotun

Giant monsters, called tyrants, roam this Reflection, destroying cities and empires in their rampages. The people of this Reflection have gathered their power and resources to create weapons platforms called anti-tyrant suits, or ATSs. The ATSs are strong enough to fend off the tyrants, but are too large to be used by anyone but the jotun. These jotun pilots are known as crownbreakers.

Whenever a tyrant appears, a crownbreaker with a dedicated support team must don their ATS and do battle. Their support team either keeps the ATS functional, or directly fights in the field.

This Reflection's Scourge is a particularly powerful tyrant that threatens the stability of society and pushes the crownbreakers to the limit.

The maji of Conduit led their Reflection's most powerful civilization for centuries, propelling society ahead with their technological innovations. Then, they messed it all up with one cataclysmic mistake.

Through hubris, oversight, or ignorance, the maji unleashed what was to be their greatest achievement, only to have it backfire. Unbeknownst to them, the maji were the Scourge .

But the maji - and their Reflection - survived. Now they're determined to either fix their mistake, or fix the world they ruined.

## EXAMPLE REFLECTION: MONTON Name: Gob

The gobs of Monton sometimes undergo a sudden metamorphosis, rapidly changing their size and abilities. The most common form (and the one they're born into) is that of a basic goblit, which is also the smallest. In their second 'hobgob' stage, they grow in size and strength. The third form is that of the 'bokgob' , which is even stronger and begins to develop wildly varied appearances like fur, extra arms, or a thick hide.

The exact reasons why only some gobs undergo this metamorphosis and why some never progress beyond the goblit stage are unknown. The leading theory is that it's a genetic mutation.

There is rumored to be a stage of metamorphosis beyond bokgob - the 'urgob' stage. There are no recorded cases of urgobs, but if it is stronger than the bokgob stage, it must be incredibly powerful.

## 7: CLASSES AND JOBS

Classes are collections of abilities you unlock over time. Each class has an associated job , which is something you can choose to equip at the beginning of a quest. Jobs grant traits and determine the base values of your attributes.

Classes are thematically connected collections of equipment and techniques that you can equip for quests, and each is associated with a job. The description of each class includes some optional questions to help flesh out your character and their connection to that class.

Each class has three ranks, starting at class rank 1 and going up to class rank 3 . Whenever your beacon levels up , including at level 1, they acquire a new class rank, either gaining a new class at rank 1 or increasing their current rank in a class by one step.

## VARIANT JOBS

Each of the classes in this book have one associated job, which shares the same name as the class; however, future books may introduce variant jobs, and you can always add new jobs in your own games.

For example, this book includes only one job for the Paladin class - also called the Paladin - but a future book might add another job for the Paladin class, called the Avenger. In that case, upon reaching rank 1 in the Paladin class you could choose to unlock either the Paladin job or the Avenger job, but not both.

You unlock one of a class's associated jobs upon reaching rank 1 in that class. Jobs give you access to specific traits and determine the base values for your attributes, like your HP and the number and size of your weapon slots. Once you have unlocked a job, your beacon can equip it whenever they go on a quest. They can only equip one job at a time.

Every rank you have in a class also unlocks two abilities for your character. These abilities can be weapons, support items, spells, or skills. Once an ability is unlocked, it enters the pool of abilities you can equip when you go on a quest.

You aren't limited to equipping techniques and equipment associated with the job you've equipped. In fact, you are encouraged to mix equipment and techniques from both the basic options (p. 216) and all of your unlocked classes.

<!-- image -->

## ELEMENTS OF A JOB

Each job has several elements: a role, base attributes, some traits, weapon slots and support slots of various types, and a limit break.

Role: A job's role describe what sorts of things characters with that job do in combat:

- Ø Artillery: Deals damage over long range.
- Ø Controller: Manipulates foes or the battlefield to gain an advantage.
- Ø Defender: Protects their allies or draws attention to themselves.
- Ø Striker: Deals damage over close-to-medium range.
- Ø Support: Assists allies, either by healing, mitigating damage, or enhancing other characters.

Base Attributes: A character's equipped job determines the starting values for their attributes.

Each attribute is listed beneath an ability score ( BULK , AGILITY , MIND , or MAGIC ). These attributes are modified by the points you have put into the relevant ability score. The values listed for attributes are the starting values, assuming 0 points invested in the related ability score.

- Ø SCOPE: The distance within which you can use certain abilities, such as ranged spell attacks.
- Ø SAVE TARGET: The target number characters have to meet or exceed when rolling a save against you.

## Bulk

- Ø HP: When you reach 0 HP, you take a Wound and make a wound roll. When you reach your WOUND CAP (4), you are defeated.
- Ø RECOVERIES: A resource you can spend to recover HP and repair destroyed equipment and techniques.

## Agility

- Ø DODGE: The number that attackers must equal or exceed to hit you.
- Ø SPEED: The number of spaces you can move with your standard movement.

## Mind

- Ø STRESS CAP: When you exceed your STRESS CAP , you take an Overstress and make an overstress roll. When you reach your OVERSTRESS CAP (4), you are defeated.
- Ø MEMORY: You can equip any number of techniques the combined MEMORY cost of which doesn't exceed your MEMORY .

## Magic

- Ø A-DEF: The number that attackers must equal or exceed to hit you with Aetheric attacks.
- Ø MP: A resource you can spend to use certain abilities.

Traits: Each job has several unique abilities. If you equip a different job, you lose access to the traits from your current job and gain the traits of the new one.

Weapon Slots: Your job determines the number and type of weapon slots available.

Support Slots: Your job determines the number and type of the support item slots available.

Limit Break: Limit breaks are powerful, unique abilities that can be used once per quest.

DEFENDER

Defense-oriented spellcasters adept with protective magic. Aegises put up barriers and shields to protect friends and block out foes.

A egises are defensive spellcasters that specialize in creating barriers and mitigating damage. Aegises rely on efficient use of mana to keep their barriers up for prolonged periods of time, and a group of them can maintain a city-spanning barrier for the duration of a siege.

## BASE ATTRIBUTES

While the primary purpose of an aegis's barriers is protection, they can also be used offensively. A well-placed wall can split a group of enemies or cut off an avenue of attack. For these reasons, aegises find themselves in high demand, especially in militaristic organizations and cities. They are at their strongest when there are people to protect, so they are seldom alone.

Aegises use many methods to extend their mana capacity and lessen the cost of spells: magical tattoos that act as miniature ley lines, mana batteries and potions, and arcane familiars are just some of the tools used by different schools of aegises.

- Ø What are your barriers made of, and what do they look like?
- Ø When  did  you  fail  to  protect someone or something?
- Ø What does it feel like when one of your barriers breaks?
- Ø What is the longest one of your barriers has lasted for?

## LIMIT BREAK

| Perfect Shield   | SPECIAL       |

| LIMIT BREAK      | RANGE = SCOPE |

At any time during a combat scene, you may choose an ally within RANGE . Until the end of this phase in the next round, all damage and STRESS they receive is reduced to 0.

The pinnacle of barrier magic is a shield that grows stronger the more force is used against it. Such a perfect shield is unbreakable, but hard to master and incredibly draining.

Aegises are fragile, backline defenders. MANA TRANSFERAL allows them to protect allies without needing to generate FOCUS first, meaning as long as they have MP , they can use defensive abilities. Aegises can't use WARD on themselves, so they are incentivized to pick abilities that will keep them away from enemies.

Dome Barrier CHANNEL SPELL  2 MEMORY  ARCING, MANA 3, SUMMON RANGE = SCOPE

Dome Barrier ( SIZE 4 , HP 20 , DODGE/A-DEF 5 , SPEED 0 )

On Release: Create a dome barrier within RANGE . Other characters can share spaces with this barrier. 1/turn when a character or object fully within the barrier is targeted by an attack from outside the barrier, you may roll a d6: on 4+, the attack instead targets the barrier. This barrier can't perform any actions (including reactions) even if another ability would allow it to do so.

Only the most skilled aegises can create these one-way barriers that block incoming attacks but allow outgoing attacks to pass freely.

## Force Shield SUPPORT ITEM  LIGHT

Whenever you take damage and you aren't STUNNED , you may treat your ARMOR as equal to half your current MP . After doing so, spend 1 MP .

You gain the SHIELD BLOCK reaction. If you meet this reaction's trigger condition while using INTERPOSE , you can automatically use its effect as part of that INTERPOSE reaction.

Force shields are defensive artifacts, crafted as small talismans or tattoos that rest upon the hand. When aether is funneled into the shield, it manifests an aetheric barrier.

Masters of potions and consumables. Alchemists bring a wide array of support items into combat to prepare for any situation.

B ubbling cauldrons, explosive concoctions, and brightly colored liquids are the telltale signs of an alchemist. They mix together ingredients and magic to create powerful potions that can be used by anyone.

## BASE ATTRIBUTES

Merchant-alchemists tend to have a few recipes they can produce reliably, but beacons are a step above. They have the skill and knowledge to produce rarer and more varied effects than can be found in a potion shop.

- Ø What was your first concoction supposed to do, and what did it actually do?
- Ø What is a signature element of your concoctions - an ingredient, flavor, or effect?
- Ø What type of ingredients do you prefer  to  use?  Plants,  monster parts, something else?
- Ø What is the ultimate creation you want to perfect, but haven't yet?

## Philosopher's Stone LIMIT BREAK

MINOR ACTION

You reveal your philosopher's stone. It has 6 charges, which last until the end of the scene. You and your allies can use these charges in place of spending Consumable charges or MP for other abilities, at a 1:1 rate. Abilities with no charges remaining can still be used if they use these charges.

The formula to create a philosopher's stone is a carefully guarded secret, shared with only the greatest alchemists. To use one is not a decision made lightly.

Alchemists have the unique ability to replenish Consumable charges during rests with POTION BELT , or even during combat with their SCORPION GAUNTLET . Most Consumable abilities are support items, and Alchemists can equip a lot of them. Alchemists can change their playstyle depending on the types of support items they equip, especially when equipping ones from other classes.

You can expend a charge for one of the following effects, which can be used on yourself or an adjacent ally:

- Ø Panacea: The target can clear one condition and all Discord.
- Ø Vigor: The target gains +4 TEMP HP and +1 on their next ability check or save.

Healing potions are the most popular alchemical product. Infusions are a specialized derivative of them that are harder to make.

VOLLEY

This AOE is a zone . Choose one of the following effects. The zone lasts for the rest of the scene or until you either use this ability again or are SILENCED , STUNNED , or defeated.

- Ø Exchange: Choose Physical, Astral, or Lunar. Free spaces in the zone become dangerous terrain ( AGILITY, 5 damage of the chosen type).
- Ø Reduction: Difficult terrain , dangerous terrain , and other non-cover terrain features in the zone no longer have any effects. Combat scene objectives are unaffected.

Some alchemists apply their scientific discoveries to the art of transmutation. With the simple principle of transmuting one substance into another, an alchemist can rapidly transform one material into something radically different.

On Hit (1/attack): If the target was an enemy, one of your Consumable abilities regains 1 charge.

Articulated claws overlap the user's fingers with a needlelike tail along the forearm. The tail can strike at nearby foes, injecting poison while extracting aetheric energy. Once enough energy has been extracted, the mechanism distills it into small vials.

- Ø Sticky Bomb: Make a melee weapon attack against a target within Range. On a hit, they are IMMOBILIZED . After their next turn, they can make a BULK save as a minor action. Success: They clear this condition, dealing 2 ASTRAL to themselves and any other characters within BLAST 1 .

Alchemy requires  a  great  deal  of  trial  and  error. Thankfully, even 'errors' can still be useful.

## RANK 3

## Grand Infusions MINOR ACTION SUPPORT ITEM  MAIN  CONSUMABLE 2

You can expend a charge for one of the following effects,  which  can  be  used  on  yourself  or  an adjacent ally:

- Ø Cleanse: The target clears all conditions.
- Ø Expertise: Roll 2d6. The target's next attack roll, check, or save can't be less than the result. You can spend 1 MP to reroll one of the dice. You can do this multiple times.
- Ø False Life: Until the end of the target's next turn, if they are reduced to 0 HP or exceed their STRESS CAP , they don't take the Wound or Overstress. Damage and Stress continue to accumulate. If, at the end of their next turn they are still at 0 HP or less, or over their STRESS CAP , they take the Wound or Overstress.

Grand infusions are the hardest concoctions for an alchemist to make. Most puzzling is that, by necessity, each alchemist has their own formula for grand infusions. No alchemist has ever been able to replicate an existing formula, even under perfect conditions. Every alchemist has to make their own.

## Mutagen REACTION SUPPORT ITEM  MAIN  CONSUMABLE 3

Trigger: Y ou or a character within SCOPE fails an attack roll, save, or check.

Effect: You expend a charge to roll 1d6 and add the result to that character's total, potentially turning a failure into a success.

Recent advancements in genetics have given alchemists the ability to splice together foreign gene-sequences, mutating the test subject. While still an active field of development, short-term mutations can be triggered to grant the subject temporary boosts.

Walking armories of weapons. Arsenals can summon new weapons at a moment's notice, surrounding themselves with a nimbus of steel.

A rsenals carry nearly limitless numbers of weapons. They can infuse weapons with mana, creating bonds between themselves and their weapons. These weapons can then be manipulated with mana, flying around at the arsenal's command, or diffusing into raw aether to be summoned at a later time.

Arsenals can bind a nearly limitless number of weapons to their souls, but manifesting them causes strain. The more weapons an arsenal summons, the greater the strain. To get around this, skilled arsenals rapidly switch between weapons, dismissing one as soon as an attack is finished, using the momentum to summon a new one and flow into the next attack.

Arsenals can customize their playstyle through their equipped weaponry. Their weapon slots, PHANTOM ARMORY , and FLEX WEAPONS allow them to equip more weapons than any other class. Arsenals usually seek out interesting weapons from other classes and a handful of passive skills to support their intended strategy.

When you attack with a weapon, you can spend 1 MP to change the damage to another non-Discord damage type of your choice (i.e., Physical, Astral, Lunar, or Force). This new damage type remains until you use this ability again.

Arsenals bind enough weapons to their souls that they have one for every situation. Switching out one weapon for an identical weapon with a different blade happens with a mere thought.

Assassins are stealthy attackers, experts at taking out isolated or vulnerable targets.

A ssassins deal in death. Their skills are used for taking lives through stealth, subterfuge, or force.

Anyone can commit murder. An assassin's strength comes from being undetected and getting away with it. They rely on their skills and training to stay hidden for as long as possible, choosing the right time to strike. Magic isn't a necessary part of their work, but many find it helpful. These assassins branch out into other classes, picking and choosing tools and tricks to enhance their unique approaches.

- Ø Who was the first person you killed, and how did you do it?
- Ø What is your signature style or method for dispatching targets?
- Ø Do you operate secretly, publicly, or under an alias?
- Ø How did you become an assassin, or why do you have their skills?

An assassin's job is to take lives, and their reputation relies on results. There is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. The assassin will find you - it's just a matter of time.

Assassins want to get in close to their targets to take advantage of Assassinate , but their low HP means they need to avoid taking damage. Their high DODGE and stealth abilities help them do this, and abilities from the Shadow Dancer class synergize with this playstyle well.

Berserkers are reckless warriors, able to unleash devastating attacks with little regard for their own safety.

Aether reacts to your emotions, building upon itself until you are teeming with it. You raise your weapon and your energy pours into it. As you bring the weapon down, the excess of aetheric forces makes your strike stronger than ever. A frightening attack that could fell titans - a primal strike.

Berserkers are extremely dangerous when they critically hit, and can lean into this aspect of their playstyle by finding abilities that can make them more likely to achieve this (abilities that increase their , for example), or that do more things when they critically hit (like the Deadeye talent).

## C H R O N O M A N C E R CONTROLLER

Chronomancers manipulate time to avoid or mitigate damage. They can alter the flow of time, speeding it up or slowing it down as needed.

C hronomancy is a rare but powerful form of magic. The more common it becomes, the more it is regulated. Entire civilizations have been wiped out by abuse of the timelines, and unintended consequences follow those who meddle with such forces.

## BASE ATTRIBUTES

Chronomancers aware of the existence of other Reflections have noted that their ability to control time does not extend past the boundaries of their current Reflection. It is not possible to alter the timelines of Reflections other than the one in which they currently reside.

- Ø What does time look like to you? Individual  threads,  a  spinning wheel,  interlocking  gears,  or something else?
- Ø What is something you have or know of from a different timeline?
- Ø How do you think the timeline should be handled? Protected, changed, cultivated, or something else?
- Ø What is something you wish you could change in the timeline, and what prevents you from being able to do it?

SPECIAL

At the start of a round, you may restructure the order of phases for that round only. You can put them in any order with the exception of PHASE DELAY , which is always the last phase in a round.

Chronomancers can distort space-time in localized areas. By exploiting a time loop to gain more aether than normally possible, they can amplify the distortion to  effectively  shuffle  time,  albeit  for  only  a  few moments.

The Chronomancer is a complex class with abilities that let them break the normal flow of combat, like FRONT OF THE TIMELINE and BORROWED TIME . Chronomancers can easily branch out into offensive or supportive playstyles with their high base MP and MEMORY .

On Release: All characters in the AOE take 2 STRESS and are SLOWED until the end of their next turn.

This is a particularly horrifying spell, but not for the obvious reasons. Yes, your movements and reactions are slowed, but two things operate at their normal speed : your mind, and your nerves.

This lasts for the rest of the scene or until you either use this spell again or they gain a Wound or Overstress .

Haste spells supercharge their target's aetheric field, manifesting as electrical discharges. The target can act beyond their normal limits in this state, but it is a perilous balance that can be easily disrupted.

## Revert REACTION

Trigger: A character with a Rewind marker either takes damage, takes STRESS caused by another character, or starts their turn.

Effect: Y ou negate any damage or Stress taken and teleport them back to the marker or the closest free spaces, then remove the marker. This counts as forced movement. If they are unwilling, they can make a MAGIC save. Success: They resist this effect and remove the marker.

Failure: Y ou are removed from play for that round, appearing in the same space or nearest free space at the start of the next round. While removed from play, you can't take any damage, be affected by anything, or take a turn.

This effect persists between scenes until you take a Long Rest .  Y ou can't use this ability again until you fail the save or take a Long Rest .

You pull a version of yourself from an alternate timeline to temporarily assist. It's considered rude to not offer to return to the favor.

Demon hunters walk a dark path, willingly accepting corrupting influences in exchange for greater power. To hunt demons, they need the power of demons.

D emon hunters are outcasts from society, shunned by the worlds that they have decided to protect. Many of their kind fall to temptation, giving into the corruption that slowly eats away at their soul. There is no happy ending for one such as them. They either give in to corruption, or die fighting.

Many demon hunters start their training by studying one specific type of demon, learning how it thinks, moves, and fights.

If they were successful, the trophy becomes an important catalyst in their first taste of corruption.

Masters of summoning magic, demonologists call forth fiends and spirits from outside the world and manifest them in their reality. These beings are merely pawns for demonologists to use.

D emonologists use their magical powers to rip holes in the fabric of reality, pulling out demons and other creatures to do their bidding. The process of becoming a demonologist is dangerous, as untrained summoners risk bringing forth creatures that they can't control.

Not all creatures summoned by demonologists are demons. They can just as easily pull creatures from other planes, alternate timelines, or the spaces between Reflections.

You immediately conjure up to 4 Summons drawn from all of your Summon abilities, ignoring their normal limits on quantity of Summons but otherwise following their usual restrictions. At the end of each of your turns, if any of these Summons exceed the number usually imposed by that ability, one of them is automatically affected by your SACRIFICE trait regardless of RANGE and line of sight.

Until the end of the scene, if the defeat of one of your Summons would result in the destruction of the underlying ability (like with GERT'S BACKBONE ), the ability is only destroyed if the last instance of that Summon is defeated.

It is neither wise nor recommended to summon every demon in your lexicon, but then again, summoning demons isn't recommended in the first place.

Demonologists are a summoning class, but tend to treat their Summons as disposable.

You summon an echo of your dragon within RANGE . This dragon has flight and can move up to its SPEED during your turn. Allies can share spaces with it, and any allies fully within its spaces can move with it when it moves. The dragon lasts until the end of the scene or until defeated.

The dragon can also attack with the ECHO WAVE weapon as a standard action during your turn, adding your GRIT to the attack roll.

The bond a dragon rider has with their mount is deep, and requires both creatures to weave their aetheric fields together. Many fail to do this, resulting in a backlash against the creature with the weaker field, which is usually the rider. Aetheric backlashes can cause serious injury or permanent physical changes in the likeness of the more powerful creature.

Once the bond is complete, the rider and dragon become one. The strongest dragon riders can pour their mana into creating an echo of their companion made of pure aether. Even if their dragon companion is long dead, a dragon rider is never alone - their partner will live on inside them.

On Channel: You begin calling a furious storm, and all adjacent characters of your choice are pushed 1 space away from you. If you stop channeling this ability before releasing for any reason, you do not expend your limit break .

On Release: You create a 4 × 4 storm zone within RANGE .  The storm lasts until the end of the scene and its spaces are difficult terrain .

Characters within the storm when it is created or who enter one of its spaces take 1D6+4 PHYSICAL , no more than 1/turn per character. If a character ends their turn in one of the storm's spaces, you may slide them up to 3 spaces .

- Ø Minor Action ( 1 MP ): You move the storm up to 3 spaces in a straight line.

'We thought they was normal storm clouds, though they did seem to form outta nowhere. There wasn't no forecast of rain, neither. But the lightning started immediately, even before the rain. And then the winds hit. You've never felt winds like this. Funnels of dust were everywhere, and they swept us off our feet. When I woke up, the ground was scrubbed clean. No bushes, no grass, just rock.'

E quinoxes pull celestial aether from beyond the bounds of their planet, mixing it with the native aether around them. This celestial aether comes in two types - sun aether and moon aether - though they do not necessarily originate from a literal sun and moon.

Sun aether is dangerous and destructive. Spells empowered with sun aether explode violently. Moon aether, on the other hand, is stable and strong. Spells empowered with moon aether can keep their form over longer distances.

- Ø Which type of aether - sun or moon - is easier for you to use, and which one do you fear?
- Ø What spell do you know that others have declared too dangerous to use?
- Ø What celestial event are you waiting for,  during  which  something important will happen? An eclipse, a conjunction, or something else?

- Ø Minor Action: You set your Sun or Moon at 1 (setting the other at 0), or clear all Sun and Moon . If you already have 1 Sun or 1 Moon , you can instead increase it by +1 , to a maximum of 2 .

Sun and Moon have the following effects:

- Ø Sun: For each Sun you have, your AOE spells and artifact weapons gain +1 to their AOEs ( Line AOEs have their width increased by +1, instead); however, you must spend +1 MP each time you use one of these spells or weapons. If you can't, you immediately lose all Sun .
- Ø Moon: For each Moon you have, your SCOPE and RANGE with artifact weapons and spells that have a RANGE increase by +4; however, you take 1 STRESS each time you target something with a spell or artifact weapon attack beyond your normal SCOPE or the weapon's RANGE .

LIMIT BREAK  ARCING, MANA 1

RANGE = SCOPE, BLAST 1

If you stop channeling this ability before releasing for any reason, it does not expend your limit break.

On Release: One character in the center of the AOE is auto-hit by a spell attack for 2D6+2 FORCE . All other characters in the AOE are auto-hit for half of that damage.

You can spend up to +3 MP when you release this ability, increasing the damage by 1D6 FORCE for each additional MP spent. You may also apply the benefits of any amount of Sun and Moon to this ability (to a max of 2 each), which affect this ability as if it were a spell. This does not require you to have any Sun or Moon or spend any amount of either.

Combining sun and moon aether at the same time results in a cataclysmically dangerous spell. An equinox who knows how to cast this spell, and is still alive, is a master of their craft.

The Equinox's DAY/NIGHT CYCLE lets them switch between long-range spells or large AOEs, although the cost for repeatedly using each resource can add up quickly. Equinoxes can focus on increasing their MP or STRESS CAP to let them use these effects for longer. Picking up spell attacks from other classes can give an Equinox more versatility.

At any time during a combat scene, you may refuse the call of death. Until the end of the scene, you can't take a fourth Wound and don't make any wound rolls. When you would take your fourth Wound, you instead return to your maximum HP and carry over any excess damage.

Gravewalkers have walked the path of the dead. They know what lies on the other side of life. To kill a gravewalker is to put them on a path they have already marked before. As long as they can 'walk', they can always come back.

Gunslingers carry specialized ammunition, developed to support their unique strengths and weaknesses. This ammunition can't be mass-produced because it contains volatile or experimental materials.

Gunslingers  lean  towards  weapons  with  the Reloading tag, as their traits helps them mitigate that penalty. Increasing their MP pool can also allow them to reload more often. While Gunslingers are naturally drawn toward long-range combat, their base traits can also work with melee weapons.

Hexblades sow curses and confusion among their foes, weakening them while growing stronger from their misery.

H exblades know pain and misery better than most. These warriors can take the suffering in their heart and use it to power an array of curses and hexes. To a hexblade, the soul is just another power source.

## BASE ATTRIBUTES

Hexes are blights upon creatures with aetheric fields. The simplest of them induce minor aetheric imbalances, causing clumsiness and inability to focus. The strongest ones act like magical parasites, using their hosts own aether to produce ongoing, detrimental effects like loss of vision and internal decay.

- Ø What's the worst luck you had?
- Ø How  does  the  shape  and appearance of your soul alter your weapons and techniques?
- Ø What's your favorite curse to put on people?
- Ø How do you get under people's skin?

This spell deals +1 damage for every condition the target had at the time of the attack.

On Hit: The target is MARKED . Additionally, choose one of the following:

- Ø Haze Curse: Until the MARK is cleared, your target treats you as INVISIBLE.
- Ø Soul Curse: Until the MARK is cleared, your target receives +1 on checks and saves.

Curses are natural phenomena that affect a creature's aetheric field. Warlocks have learned how to manipulate these forces to induce specific types of curses. Hexblades take that knowledge and force these curses into physical forms that can be cast at any creature.

## Curse of Weakness SPELL  2 MEMORY

When you make a character MARKED , you can spend 2 MP to also make them WEAKENED until the end of their next turn.

Misfortune follows hexblades. The smart ones learn how to make that someone else's problem.

## Soul Strike SKILL  3 MEMORY  MANA 1

When you attack with a weapon, you can turn it into a soul strike .  The attack gains the Aetheric tag, deals half damage, and deals all damage as STRESS instead of its normal types.

It additionally gains On Hit: the target is DAZED until the end of their next turn. If the STRESS from this attack causes them to exceed their STRESS CAP , they are also SUNDERED until it is both the end of their next turn and they are no longer exceeding their STRESS CAP .

It is possible to convert a weapon's entire form into aether. The aetheric weapon bypasses physical armor, but interacts directly with aetheric fields.

Knightmares manifest dreams into reality, creating unbreakable aetheric chains to bind their foes. If a Knightmare catches you, there's no escape.

T he Dreamscape is a realm few know about, and accessible to even fewer. The Awoken are those who can travel this realm of infinite creativity and shape it to their whims; however, not everything there is pleasant, and dangers lurk in the shadows.

## BASE ATTRIBUTES

Knightmares have been influenced by their brushes with the horrors of the Dreamscape - true nightmares. Using these strong negative emotions, they can take objects from the Dreamscape into the waking world, which display properties that make a mockery of reality.

- Ø When  did  you  first  become Awoken?
- Ø How do you choose to look in the Dreamscape?
- Ø Who do you hope to capture in your chains?
- Ø What nightmare still plagues you to this day?

Trigger: An enemy within RANGE 3 makes an attack.

Effect: You pull the enemy to the closest free space adjacent to you, and their attack must include you as a target. You may also spend an additional +1 FOCUS to GRAPPLE the enemy after pulling them.

## The Inescapable Nightmare

TRAIT

When you would be able to make a melee attack as a reaction , you can instead attempt a GRAPPLE .

Additionally, 1/round if a GRAPPLED enemy would cease to be adjacent to you, you can spend 1 MP to continue the grapple and negate any movement that would break adjacency.

You can't use this trait if you are STUNNED .

You are always considered at least SIZE 3 for the purposes of GRAPPLE and SHOVE and you can perform reactions while GRAPPLED.

## LIMIT BREAK

## Trapped in a Dream LIMIT BREAK

<!-- image -->

All enemies of your choice within RANGE 5 are pulled to the closest free spaces adjacent to you and GRAPPLED . Escaping from the grapple requires a standard action during any phase instead of a minor action. Any time an enemy GRAPPLED by this ability attacks, they must include you as one of their targets.

Your chains move according to your will, wrapping around your foes and dragging them screaming toward you. As they move closer, they find themselves transported into a domain of the dreamscape chosen especially for them. They can see the waking world, but the dreamscape fights them every step of the way.

Knightmares are a grapple-focused class. The Brawler talent can help them GRAPPLE more often, and grappling tends to shut down enemy defenders, who usually rely on reactions to use their defensive features. THE WEIGHT OF INEVITABILITY means that Knightmares don't need to pick specific ancestries to remain in control while grappling.

## RANK 1

## Body Shields SKILL  1 MEMORY  UNIQUE

Any Physical, Astral, Lunar, and Force you would take is reduced by -1 (before ARMOR and resistances ) for every character GRAPPLED by you. When characters GRAPPLED by you deal damage to you, they don't count toward this damage reduction.

This weapon is wrapped in dream-chains, brought from the dreamscape into the waking world. Their strength is unparalleled, unbound by the constraints of reality. With a flick of your wrist, the chain shoots out and binds your victim, pulling them close.

Lifeweavers are battlefield medics who weave flesh together. They can keep their friends active and fighting even through deadly injuries.

L ifeweavers have unique insights into the dynamics of aetheric fields and can use magic to heal wounds instantly. This knowledge also makes them dangerous fighters, as they know exactly how to hurt or incapacitate foes and turn their own aetheric fields against them.

## BASE ATTRIBUTES

These healers have honed their training for the battlefield. Their healing magic may not be as effective as proper medical attention, but it serves its purpose of quickly repairing minor injuries and letting people continue fighting.

- Ø What mark is left behind on those you've healed?
- Ø What type of effects or injuries do you find difficult to fix?
- Ø What do aetheric fields look like to you, and how is yours different?

The ability to bring someone back from the dead, no matter how long has passed, exists only in legend. However, there is a very short window of time where life can be restored to the recently departed.

A lifeweaver can repair and stimulate a person's aetheric field before it completely breaks down, breathing life back into their body and repairing some of the recent damage they've taken.

Lifeweavers have many ways of keeping their allies healthy during fights, from granting TEMP HP to pure healing. Lifeweavers play a versatile supporting role, especially when combined with other classes like the Tidecaller .

Paladins draw upon their resolve to protect their allies and smite their foes. They can manifest beneficial auras that enhance nearby allies.

P aladins are motivated individuals driven by their beliefs. What separates a paladin from an advocate is their ability to turn their resolve into power, bolstering their aetheric field and gaining strength through their convictions.

## BASE ATTRIBUTES

Most paladins are very protective of their friends and will willingly put themselves in harm's way to save one from danger. Their desire to protect becomes so strong that when they sense a threat, they can travel great distances in the blink of an eye to stand ready against it.

- Ø What is a belief you hold onto strongly?
- Ø What sensation or emotion do people feel when they're near you?

## LIMIT BREAK

## Gateway LIMIT BREAK

## MINOR ACTION

You create two SIZE 3 gateways on free solid surfaces within RANGE 15 , ignoring line of sight. These gateways aren't obstructions, don't block line of sight, and last until the end of the scene.

1/turn when a character fully enters a gateway, they are immediately teleported to the other gateway, being placed in a space of their choice so they are fully within the gateway. If a character enters a gateway as a result of forced movement, their forced movement continues in the same direction from the other gateway starting in a space chosen by whoever initiated the forced movement.

If a character cannot end this teleport fully within the gateway (e.g., because too many spaces are occupied), the teleport fails.

Riftcutters can be overcharged with energy, allowing them to create larger and more stable rifts. With the proper  architecture,  these  gateways  can  become permanent portals, allowing instant travel between two places; however, the portable power packs that riftblades carry aren't strong enough, and the gateways they create will eventually close.

The Riftblade is a complicated class that use their RIFT trait to gain range and angles on their enemies. Careful positioning of a rift is necessary, as enemies can attack them through it. Try placing rifts in cover or where enemies can't reach.

Icy armor grows over rimeguards, granting layers of protection that grow stronger over time.

T he Rimeguard's source of power is their frozen heart. A splinter of ice formed from the death of an ancient elemental spirit is driven into their heart, encasing it in ice and freezing the blood in their veins. Those that survive the process become one with the forces of cold.

## BASE ATTRIBUTES

The icy splinters needed to create a rimeguard are rare, and as a result, rimeguards are an uncommon sight. Their  rarity  combined  with  their cold and distant demeanor, gives rimeguards a frightening reputation that is only sometimes earned.

- Ø Who did you save from certain death?
- Ø Where were you when you realized you would change the world?
- Ø What can't you feel when you channel the cold?

MINOR ACTION

You and your allies (ignoring line of sight) clear all Stress and reduce their current SURGE level by 1.

The rimeguard drops the temperature to absolute zero, freezing everything in its tracks. With a snap of their fingers, the cold breaks. Absolute zero lasts only for a moment, but it's enough for the rimeguard's allies to cool off.

Rimeguards want to generate as much FOCUS as possible, allocating it between TEMP HP granted by FROST ARMOR and their other FOCUS needs. Because of their unique mechanism for stacking TEMP HP , rimeguards can either keep the TEMP HP for themselves and adopt an interposing defender style, or play the role of the backline defender by sharing TEMP HP with allies.

Shapeshifters are able to assume various forms to overcome obstacles, transforming their entire body or individual parts as needed.

S hapeshifters can change their bodies, taking on the features of other creatures or changing into different creatures altogether. The earliest shapeshifters were lycanthropes studying the way their transformations worked. Over time, they discovered how to transform specific parts of their bodies, and eventually how to choose what they transformed into.

## BASE ATTRIBUTES

| SCOPE:      | 10   | SAVE TARGET:   | 10   |

| SPEED:      | 5    | MP:            | 4    |

This type of shapeshifting is notable because it's a learned skill, not a spell. The shapeshifter carefully rearranges their aetheric balance until it precisely aligns with the typical aetheric balance of the creature they're shapeshifting into. While their form may be different, they're still the same person they were before. A shapeshifter that transforms into a bear isn't actually a bear; they're merely adopting the outward form of a bear.

- Ø What does it look like when you transform?
- Ø What physical trait carries over to each form you assume?
- Ø When  was  the  first  time  you changed your shape, and what was it?
- Ø What form or changes feel most natural to you?

FREE ACTION

You channel lightning directly into your body, pushing it past its physical limits and immediately gaining 6 Flurry . Until the end of the scene, your Fast as Lightning trait doesn't cost MP . When you spend 6 Flurry to make a Stunning Strike , the target automatically fails the save.

A bolt of magical lightning strikes the thunderclaw, but instead of discharging it, they hold it within their body. Years of careful training allow the thunderclaw to take this influx of energy and use it to enhance their physical abilities.

Supercharged thunderclaws can dart across the battlefield at breakneck speeds, delivering lightningcharged strikes strong enough to punch through steel. Lightning arcs off their body while in this state, as they contain the raw power of a bolt of lightning.

Held lightning still wants to find a way out of a thunderclaw's body, and the longer it is held, the greater the damage to the thunderclaw. If not discharged, this technique will eventually kill the user.

Thunderclaws are highly mobile, with abilities that allow them to quickly move around a battlefield, and others that require specific positioning to maximize their effects. The more attacks a Thunderclaw makes, the more Flurry they can generate, so the Stormdancer talent's third rank and other abilities that allow for extra attacks are good choices for this class.

Wardens can connect and attune to any planet or plane to which they travel, although doing so may change how their powers look or work. Traveling to a dimension of fire, for example, a warden might find their hair turning to flame, and their powers becoming wreathed in flame.

- Ø What creature or spirit did you learn from?
- Ø How does the planet communicate with you?

Experimental Weapon 3 VOLLEY (RANGED) / 5 FIGHT (MELEE)

## COMMANDER

The  difference  between  a  good  commander  and  a bad one is trust. A bad commander issues orders and expects them to be followed because of their rank. A good commander knows their troops and trusts them to follow orders, and the team trusts the commander to keep them alive.

## Rank 1: Commander's Mark

When you make a character MARKED , you can make it a special Commander's Mark . It functions as a normal MARK , but when an ally consumes it, you roll a 1d6: on a 5+, the target stays MARKED with the Commander's Mark.

You can SEARCH as a minor action .

## Rank 2: Copy

When you SEARCH an enemy to learn about their ability scores, attributes, and abilities, you can spend 1 MP to gain access to one of those pieces of equipment or techniques until the end of the scene. You can only copy one thing at a time.

## Rank 3: Imitate

Copy can now be used to gain access to enemy traits, and you can copy up to two things at once.

Additionally, when an enemy uses a piece of equipment, technique, or trait within your line of sight, you can spend 1 MP to gain access to it until the end of the scene.

The COPYCAT talent is intended for fun, casual play only. It's not intended to be balanced. Check with your GM to see if they want this talent to be used.

## DEADEYE

Everyone knows that you're better off hitting a specific body part than lashing out blindly, but it's incredibly difficult to put that knowledge into practice during a real fight. Those with the speed, skill, and accuracy to reliably do so can end fights quickly.

## Rank 1: Precision

Minor Action: You take 1 STRESS to gain +1 on your next attack roll this turn. On a crit, it gains the Piercing tag.

You may have one ability at a time with two Enchantments applied, instead of just one. Additionally, you can equip a single Enchantment support item for free, which can be an additional one from this talent.

In a prolonged firefight, it's just as important to avoid getting  shot  as  it  is  to  accurately  hit  your  enemies. This  fighting  style  uses  movements  meant  to  avoid the most commonly attacked areas.

## Rank 1: CQC

Your ranged weapons with REACH don't receive from being ENGAGED if your target is within their REACH .

## SECTION 3 RUNNING THE GAME

## 10: GAME MASTER'S GUIDE

This chapter is for those who are interested in running a game of BEACON . Congratulations! You are now a highly sought-after person. TTRPGs usually have more willing players than willing GMs, so by reading this chapter and running a game for people, you're bringing the joy of this game to them.

You will find that these sections are written more casually and conversationally than the past few, as they are about how you can make the game enjoyable for both your players and yourself, which is less precise a matter than the game rules themselves.

## GAME MASTER TIPS

Running BEACON can be harder than just playing it. There are more things to keep track of, more stories to tell, and it can sometimes feel overwhelming, especially for people who are new to GMing. The purpose of this section is to make that job easier.

## THE CORE PRINCIPLES

The core principles of BEACON apply to both players and the GM.

1. The well-being and fun of the group, including both the players and the GM, is the top priority.

The GM has the greatest ability to impact the fun of a game, but the players have a role as well. It's your job to make sure the story and game you're playing is fun for everyone. Anything else in the game is secondary to this rule. Sure, I've spent a lot of time trying to make the game fun to play, but if your group thinks that changing something would result in a better experience for everyone, then you should absolutely do that.

2. Specific text takes precedent over general text.

Some of the game rules in BEACON are general rules. For example, players can only perform certain actions in specific phases of combat. Weapons with the Slow tag, for instance, can only be used with the FULL ATTACK action. These are general rules.

Many of the abilities available to players allow them to break these general rules, and that's intentional. To follow on from the above example, certain abilities allow players to attack with Slow weapons without using the FULL ATTACK action. That's a specific rule - it takes precedence over the general one.

3. BEACON does not model reality or real-life physics, and is not meant to.

This is not a simulation game. The Rule of Cool is the physics engine of this game, and the combat mechanics are designed like a board game or video game.

4. Narrative play and combat play are distinct modes of play. The ability to do something in one mode does not automatically grant the ability to do it in the other.

BEACON is designed to allow a wide variety of character types to exist without hampering player creativity; however, combat play features strict rules. It was designed to be played like a board game or video game, and only uses abilities specifically designed for combat play. Even though your character might be strong enough to throw an ox in narrative play, they can't just throw people around or tear down walls in combat play. They need an ability that allows them to do so, or a GM willing to let them make an ability check to attempt it.

## 5. In combat play, players can do anything their abilities allow, even if it doesn't make narrative sense.

It is the duty of the players and GM to explain how things happen in combat play, not to find reasons why they can't work. Basically, work backwards. If you're in a cave and a player calls down a lightning bolt from the sky, it happens. Now it's your job to figure out how or why the lightning bolt struck from the sky. Is the cave large enough to have clouds? Did it break through the roof? Was there a tiny hole?

This intersects with several of the other principles listed here, such as Principle 3 and Principle 4. If a combat ability does something, it does that thing no matter what. The flavor text of that ability is just that: flavor.

## 6. Always round up to the nearest whole number.

This one's simple: when in doubt, round up.

## GAME MASTER ADVICE

This section contains suggestions and tips for running roleplaying games, especially BEACON . There are a ton of other resources on this subject, from books to podcasts and videos.

Two books I recommend are the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4th Edition Dungeon Master's Guide and Dungeon Master's Guide 2 . Both books contain a wealth of useful information applicable to running any game, not just D&amp;D.

The following tips are intentionally framed as suggestions, not rules. While they might be good practice, a skilled GM or one that knows their group might intentionally ignore one or more of them. But for new GMs, these suggestions can help you practice and improve your GMing skills.

## AVOID SAYING 'NO'

When a player has a cool idea or suggestion, try not to say 'no' to it. In improv, this known as 'Yes, AND …' , because you take the idea the other person is offering and roll with it, building on it as needed.

Of course, sometimes you do need to say 'no' . In those cases, try using 'No, BUT …' instead of just refusing. Incorporate some element of the player's offer, or give them a piece of what they were looking for.

As much as possible, try to avoid the hard 'no' .

## ESTABLISH MOTIVATIONS

When your players are creating their beacons, make sure to ask them about both what motivates their characters and what they're interested in as players. Their characters will have certain drives, but what do they want to happen with their characters as players, or what do they want to see happen during the game?

For example, a character may want to explore dungeons and collect loot, which lets you know they're motivated by treasure; however, the player might want to experience a heroic sacrifice. To help make this happen, you stay in communication with the player about how early they want that to happen, and then set a narrative scene in the game where their character can hold the line while their friends escape.

## ASK FOR PLAYER INTENTIONS

When a player is struggling to explain what they want to do, or you're having problems understanding or deciding how to rule a decision, ask the player in question what their intent is. What do they hope to accomplish? What do they want to happen? You can use these answers to help shape your decision.

For example, the player of a timid beacon might describe their character as a wallflower who avoids talking with other characters. In reality, however, the player might actually want their character to be confronted with social situations that they have to maneuver. What the character wants in this situation is different from what the player wants, and if you only used their ingame description, you might miss that. But by knowing the player's intention, you could place the character into social situations, giving them the scenes they're looking for.

## ROOT FOR THE PLAYERS

You should be a fan of your player's characters, and want them to succeed. Your job is not to have an adversarial relationship with them, to try and make them fail. Your job is to provide them with challenges to overcome . Help bring their plans to fruition and offer them challenges when needed.

It's okay if the characters fail, since that can lead to interesting stories. But you shouldn't be hoping for them to fail - ever. If you feel that way, take a step back to examine why, and see if it's something you should address with the group.

## ASK LEADING QUESTIONS

Questions are a powerful tool in your kit. They can help push players or characters into action, shed light on their internal thoughts, and help scenes evolve. You might ask questions of the players, or about what their characters are thinking or feeling in a given moment. Here are some examples:

- Ø 'What do you want to do?'
- Ø 'How do you feel at this moment?'
- Ø 'What's going through your mind?'
- Ø 'Who in the group reacts poorly to this information?'
- Ø 'Where do you think this will lead?'
- Ø 'When did you last see this same phenomenon?'

## ASK THE PLAYERS FOR IDEAS

You don't have to come up with every story idea on your own. Your players are creative people who can have really cool ideas that you wouldn't think of.

If you ever feel stumped, ask the players for help. Ask them, 'what would be cool to happen?' or, 'how do you want this to turn out?' .

## TALK TO THE GROUP

Most questions you might have about your group or about how to deal with a situation can be handled by actually talking to your group. Explain your concerns or thoughts. Don't take actions or deliver punishments in game for out-of-game situations. Don't be a jerk.

## FAIL FORWARD

Failing forward refers to the idea that, even on a failed roll, the action keeps moving forward. Having something just fail is unsatisfying because it doesn't add anything to the story, it just stops it in its tracks. Failing forward changes failures from hard stops to successes with complications.

For example, a beacon, the Quicksilver Shadow, tries to sneak past some guards in a narrative scene. They fail their skill check, but instead of being immediately caught, they are spotted as soon as they get past the guards. They've technically succeeded in their goal of getting past the guards, but now have to flee in a chase scene. Without failing forward, the Quicksilver Shadow would have just been caught or prevented from getting past the guards, which isn't anywhere near as exciting.

Failing forward is especially useful in BEACON because the characters are extremely competent heroes. It feels better and is less jarring for the legendary Quicksilver Shadow to fail forward when sneaking then to get caught.

## USE CUTSCENES

Cutscenes or vignettes can be used to show what is happening in the world, or to give insight into specific NPCs. Cutscenes are great tools for giving players information without having to reveal it to their characters.

For example, whenever the players gain a level, you might show a short cutscene of what the Scourge is doing behind the scenes. This keeps the players informed about how the story is progressing even though their characters aren't experiencing it directly.

## ADD ROLEPLAYING TO COMBAT SCENES

There are a lot of things to keep track of in combat play, and it can be easy to focus on just running scenes efficiently. Adding little bits of roleplaying, however, can help elevate your combat scenes.

Dialogue is a good way to do this. Whenever an NPC acts, narrate a line of dialogue or something they do, aside from just their combat action. Compare 'the cleaver attacks you' to 'the cleaver attacks you, announcing, 'Oh ho! You're in trouble now!'' The second version adds more to the scene.

## 'BORROW' IDEAS LIBERALLY

Take ideas from other stories you enjoy. It doesn't matter if the players are familiar with them. If they are, they might enjoy figuring out the connection and they can still be surprised if it differs from their expectations. Use other stories as blueprints for your own.

## NO TRULY HOPELESS SITUATIONS

Scenes where the heroes are defeated by an overwhelming foe only to grow stronger and then defeat them later in the story are common in media. They are also terrible ideas for combat scenes.

Combat scenes in BEACON can be long affairs. In such a situation, it's not fun to fight against someone who can't be hurt, or who instantly defeats the heroes. Even worse, it feels like a waste of time.

If you want to use this sort of scene, either handle it in narrative play, or make it the outcome of a combat scene. Perhaps the PCs win the combat scene, but in the aftermath, the villain defeats them. Holdout combat scenes (p. 248) are great for this, since they're about trying to outlast an overwhelming number of foes. 'Success' in these situations is merely avoiding the worst-case scenario.

<!-- image -->

## NO PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER

BEACON is not designed for player vs player fights, especially not in combat scenes.

If some of the beacons want to fight each other, start by evaluating why . If there's an out-of-character conflict, see if you can come up with a compromise or change a story element that will appease everyone. After all, the most important part of the game is that everyone is having fun - it's okay to change things.

If it's truly an in-character conflict, the best way to handle it is through narrative play. Have the players use the MAKE CONFLICT narrative action (p. 25) to find out how it resolves, and keep an open dialogue throughout. Discuss how the players want the scene to end and provide ways for that to happen.

## RECURRING CHARACTERS

When the beacons make a connection with an NPC, whether positive or negative, make a note of it. Try to reintroduce that NPC again at future points in the story, giving the beacons a chance to build upon their existing history with that character.

## LEGACY CHARACTERS

Has your gaming group played together before? If so, were there any NPCs or PCs that everyone enjoyed? You can introduce them into your BEACON game as legacy NPCs!

A legacy NPC is an NPC whose name appears across multiple Reflections. They are (usually) completely distinct individuals, but share similar names.

Basically, legacy characters are an excuse to introduce NPCs that your group might already be familiar with.

You can still do this even if your group hasn't played together before. You can just name existing characters after other characters you know or like. This can be helpful when you need to come up with an NPC name on the spot.

## SETTING UP THE GAME

Before you play a game of BEACON , you'll want to figure out what sort of game you're looking for. This isn't about the setting or characters, but about the type of gameplay that you're going to present to your players.

## BEACON is good at:

- Ø high fantasy
- Ø action
- Ø interesting, tactical battles
- Ø powerful player characters

## BEACON is not good at:

- Ø subterfuge and heists
- Ø intrigue and social manipulation
- Ø horror
- Ø quick battles

BEACON isn't designed for games focusing on subterfuge, intrigue, or horror. These situations are often about avoiding fights, and BEACON is very much about fighting.

That doesn't mean that BEACON can't have moments of subterfuge or intrigue. It very much can, and often does. But if you want those to be the main focus of the game, there are honestly other games that would do a better job of capturing the feeling of those stories.

If the type of game you want to play aligns with BEACON ' s strengths, then your next step will be to sit down with your players for a session 0, during which you'll go over safety tools, set the tone for your game, and design your setting. Having read this section means you'll be able to guide those conversations so they remain in line with BEACON ' s strengths.

## SESSION 0

Once you know what sort of game you want to play, you can present this information to your players during an initial meeting, before you actually begin playing the game. This is often referred to as ' Session 0 ' .

Session 0 is an opportunity to establish safety tools, discuss the type of game you will be running, design your setting together, and design the Hub your beacons will use as their base of operations.

As the GM, you should come to this session with a few key pieces of information that you want to share with the players, like what BEACON is and the type of gameplay it has. Most of the time you shouldn't show up with a fully fleshed-out setting for your players, as designing a world with player input is a fun part of the game (p. 228). It's okay to have some predetermined elements in mind, and there's nothing wrong with having a setting you already want to use if that is the case. It's just important to know that, unlike in many games, BEACON doesn't require the GM to have already developed a setting.

## SAFETY TOOLS

Safety tools are techniques and resources you can use in your game to ensure everyone playing is having fun and feeling safe.

There are numerous things that can make someone feel unsafe, but in TTRPGs, unsafe situations often arise from the content of the game. For example, one player may not be comfortable with particularly gory descriptions, while another might want to avoid scenes involving drug use.

Utilizing safety tools will help you find out which themes, topics, and scenes your players don't feel comfortable playing. It's important that you then respect

## those decisions .

For example, a player mentions during session 0 that they have a phobia of spiders; knowing that giant spiders are a common enemy in fantasy stories, they ask that the game doesn't feature spiders. The players and GM all agree, even the player that wanted to make a spider-person character, because they respect the wishes of the player and don't want to make them feel unsafe during the game.

A few sessions later, the GM forgets and begins introducing a combat scene with spiderlike enemies. Using the X-card safety tool, one of the players halts the action and reminds the GM about the request to not have spiders. The GM apologizes, redescribes the scene, and the game continues.

This section summarizes several common safety tools. You can find a more robust list of safety tools in the TTRPG Safety Toolkit Guide by Kienna Shaw and Lauren-Bryant-Monk ( bit.ly/ttrpgsafetytoolkit ).

## The X-Card

Created by John Stavropoulos

The X-card is a card or object that anyone can touch or raise. Any time there is a scene that makes someone uncomfortable, they can raise or touch the card, at which point you stop that scene .  Y ou can then discuss next steps, but the person who used the X-card doesn't have to explain their reasoning unless they want to.

There are other variants on the X-card, including the Script Change options for fast-forwarding, pausing, and rewinding, designed by Brie Beau Sheldon.

You can find out more about the X-card here: tinyurl. com/x-card-rpg

You can find out more about the Script Change RPG Toolbox here: briebeau.itch.io/script-change

## Lines and Veils

Created by Ron Edwards

To use this technique, you and the players establish any number of 'lines' and 'veils' before the game begins.

A line is a topic that should not appear in the game at all - a line that should not be crossed. For example, if someone places 'torture' as a line, torture does not happen in the game in any way, shape, or form.

A veil is a topic that can be hinted at, but not shown directly. It gets put behind a veil or curtain. Things established as veils can take place in the game, but they won't be shown directly. For example, if someone places 'romantic scenes' as a veil, these scenes can happen in the story, but we're not going to show or dwell on them.

If you or any of the players have a topic that you want to establish as a line or veil, you should mention it and track it in writing. Although they are established at the start of a game, lines and veils can be added, changed, or removed at any time during the course of a game.

You can find out more about lines and veils here: rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906

## TONE

One of the first things you should do as a group is establish the tone of your game. This helps everyone understand the sort of game they're getting into.

The tone of a game is what lets everyone know what kind of story they're going to be telling. It can describe tone in many ways, from talking about specific story beats you want to see (betrayal, adventure, destiny) or emotions you want to invoke (hope, friendship) to referencing specific media examples that you want the story to be like (like Final Fantasy 7 meets The Fast and the Furious ).

Tone can be established in a similar way to lines and veils. Every player, including the GM, can specify any tones they want included or excluded during session 0.

Deciding on a tone doesn't completely exclude other content, but it sets the default expectation. Even if you're playing a gritty, serious game, that doesn't mean that there can't be moments of levity and comedy. It just means that these should be sprinkled around the gritty assumptions. If, over time, the comedy ends up becoming the focus of the game, the players and GM should discuss whether they want to shift the tone of the game to incorporate more comedy or move back to what they originally discussed.

Tone is important for both players and the GM, as misunderstandings about a game's tone can cause friction between players. It's also okay not to have an idea for the tone until you begin designing your setting together.

## DESIGNING THE SETTING

Unlike TTRPGs with pre-established settings for their games, BEACON assumes that each gaming group will create their own setting together. These settings are called Reflections , and they make up the infinite possible worlds of the Source .

You can read more about the Source in Chapter 0: Introduction (p.  7),  and  find  some prebuilt Reflections later in this section (p. 233).

Designing the setting is a collaborative event that happens during session 0, and it's usually the last thing decided before people move onto creating their characters. Both the players and the GM get to have a say in what their Reflection is, although the GM can set guidelines or restrictions if they feel like it's necessary. For example, they might already have an idea for the Scourge, and want the players to design the rest of the Reflection with that particular Scourge in mind.

There are a few elements common across the worlds of the Source. The following are true of every Reflection:

- Ø The world is filled with action and adventure .
- Ø There are beacons - people who are sources of great inspiration for others, whether they are heroes or villains.
- Ø There is a recurring threat - the Scourge .
- Ø Crystals hold some significance to the reflection or its inhabitants.
- Ø All things are composed of varying amounts of aether ,  magical  elements that come in many varieties, including astral and lunar aspects.
- Ø Magic is widely available and has been combined with technology to create magitech devices.
- Ø Ruins dot the landscape, ready to be explored.

Although these are true of each Reflection, their exact natures are left for you and the players to decide.

## RANDOM REFLECTIONS

If you want to quickly generate a random Reflection, you can use the online Reflection generator here: https://www.pirategonzalezgames.com/resources

The following sections discuss these elements and provide prompts and guidance for making those choices. It focuses on the following:

- Ø Themes: The topics that will be most important to your story.
- Ø Beacons: The role the PCs play in your Reflection.
- Ø The Scourge: The  nature  of  your  Reflection's recurring threat.
- Ø Crystals: The  importance  of  crystals  in  your Reflection.
- Ø Aether and Magic: The way magic works in your Reflection.
- Ø Ruins and Dungeons: The nature of the ruins that wait to be explored.

## SCOPE OF STORIES

Most stories are contained within a single Reflection, or might deal with a handful of Reflections at most. Few stories deal with the Source as a whole, and the vast scope of existence. If you do want to engage with this, here are some ideas for how you could do so:

- Ø Unification: Something is bringing Reflections together, or trying to combine everything into one truth - at the cost of limitless potential.
- Ø Separation: Something destroys the Source or seeks to do so. This would let the Reflections develop on their own, untethered to the truths within the Source.
- Ø Rogue Reflection: A rogue Reflection threatens the others. Perhaps this Reflection can consume others, growing more powerful in the process.
- Ø Darkness: Darkness is dimming the light of all beacons across the Source. Without beacons, the Reflections will grow dark and hope will be lost.

## THEMES

The story you're going to tell will have certain themes in the form of prominent ideas, concepts, and other elements. These may not necessarily be things that are important in the Reflection itself, but are to the story your group is telling. For example, you might choose sacrifice as a theme. This means that sacrifices will be important to your story in some way. Maybe one of the beacons is expected to sacrifice themselves to seal the Scourge, or maybe the beacons have all been marked as sacrifices for the purposes of some great evil. In both cases, the theme of sacrifice is important to the beacons and their story, but isn't necessarily an objective truth about the Reflection itself.

As a group, ask yourselves the following questions and then pick three themes for your Reflection, choosing from the below lists or making your own:

- Ø What themes do we want in our game?
- Ø What themes don't we want in our game?

Like the tone, themes are a way for everyone to indicate the type of story they're interested in playing. For example, if everyone recently enjoyed watching a TV show about fighting corrupt institutions, someone might suggest corruption as one of the themes.

## BEACONS

Heroes. Paragons. Chosen.

Across all reflections, these legendary figures share a common name: beacon .  The characters portrayed by players in your game are heroes like these.

Beacons exist on each Reflection as inspirational or guiding figures. They can be heroes, villains, or anything else. What makes them truly special is that - one way or another - people look to them in times of trouble.

For example, the beacons of one Reflection might be heroes from a doomed timeline, trying to prevent the destruction of their world, while those of another might be people with a unique ability to resist the poisoned air of the land beneath the clouds.

As a group, ask yourselves the following questions and then decide on the role or nature of beacons in your Reflection, choosing from the below list or making your own:

- Ø What role do beacons serve in this Reflection?
- Ø How does one become a beacon?
- Ø What separates beacons from other people?

## SCOURGE

The Scourge is a recurring threat - a guaranteed event in every Reflection. Its form and nature differs between Reflections, but it always exists (or did exist) in each. The Scourge may not always be the greatest threat facing a Reflection, but it is constant.

The Scourge can be anything; the only consistent thing is that it's a threat of some sort. It's usually an entity (like a boss you can beat), but sometimes it might be an event, like two distinct worlds joining into one every 1,000 years.

Many Scourges have powerful subordinates called heralds. These dangerous beings carry out the will of the Scourge or otherwise work to bring it about, leading armies and crushing beacons who stand against them.

It is important to understand that the Scourge is a recurring threat , but not necessarily an evil . Every Reflection is unique, and sometimes a scourge is a force of evil, but sometimes it's not. Either way, it must be dealt with.

Most games of BEACON revolve around Scourges, but sometimes the Scourge isn't the real threat of the story.

As a group, ask yourselves the following questions and on decide what the Scourge is, choosing from the below list or making your own:

- Ø What is the Scourge?
- Ø Why is the Scourge recurring?
- Ø How long has the Scourge been a threat?

|   EXAMPLE SCOURGES | EXAMPLE SCOURGES                      |   EXAMPLE SCOURGES | EXAMPLE SCOURGES                 |

## RUINS AND DUNGEONS

Dungeons and ruins dot the landscape of each Reflection, enticing heroes to enter their dangerous domains.

These places tell stories. They were once meant to inspire awe or fear, and are now crumbling shadows of their former self.

Ruins serve as a convenient way to house items that are important to your story. A classic RPG trope is that the item necessary to defeat the big bad boss is housed in a ruin.

Ruins mean different things and have different origins across Reflections. In one Reflection they may be the crumpled castles and cities of a once prosperous empire, while in another they're abandoned flying laboratories from an advanced civilization that mysteriously disappeared. These would both be considered the dungeons of their respective Reflections, even though one of them doesn't match the dictionary definition of a dungeon.

As a group, answer the following questions and then decide the origin and nature of ruins:

- Ø What civilization left ruins behind? Are they still around?
- Ø What is a common feature among these types of ruins?
- Ø What unique things can be found in these ruins, that can't be found anywhere else?
- Ø Why are ruins still being discovered today?

## CRYSTALS

Crystals hold a unique role in every Reflection. In some, they contain raw magical energy. In others, they are used as a form of currency. There are infinite possibilities.

That the Source is typically described as a crystal and crystals have significant roles in each Reflection can't be a coincidence.

As a group, ask yourselves the following questions and then decide what role crystals serve:

- Ø What is the role of crystals?
- Ø How and where are crystals formed?
- Ø How are crystals obtained?

## AETHER AND MAGIC

Magic exists in every Reflection, although its use varies wildly. Some Reflections are rife with magic, while it is rare or hard to use in others.

Aether is the general term for energies that can be harnessed to produce magical effects. It can be found in everything, including people.

Regardless of how magic works in your Reflection, player characters should always have access to it in combat play. The game is designed around the idea that every beacon is able to access and use magic.

As a group, ask yourselves the following questions and then decide how magic works:

- Ø What can magic do, and what can't it do?
- Ø How common is magic?
- Ø How do people use magic? Are there different styles or traditions of magic?
- Ø What is the cost of using magic?
- Ø How has magic affected the world?

## OTHER QUESTIONS

There are some other questions you can use to further flesh out your Reflection:

- Ø How do people live? Are there cities and towns, are people nomadic, or something else?
- Ø How do people travel long distances?
- Ø What is the fastest mode of travel?
- Ø What species exist or are commonly encountered? Humans, elves, machina, or others?
- Ø What supernatural  creatures  exist?  Are  there vampires, werewolves, demons, and so on?
- Ø What currencies do people use?
- Ø Do deities exist, or do people believe they exist?
- Ø What great disaster is still in everyone's mind?
- Ø What secret about the world do people not know?

## EXISTING REFLECTIONS

To assist with the creative process and provide potential quick entry points to the game, this section details some example Reflections you can use or from which you can take inspiration.

## CRYSTAL WARRIORS

## SUMMARY

Crystal warriors are those people that can attune to job crystals , quickly gaining access to a wealth of knowledge and power. They are the destined heroes who must fight against the Scourge when it arises, defeating it and bringing a time of peace. Unknown to these warriors, however, they are perpetuating a cycle of death.

## BEACONS

In this Reflection, beacons are known as crystal warriors . They have a special aptitude for job crystals, items that grant special abilities and powers. Although anyone can use a job crystal, crystal warriors can do so with great ease, and can also access and use multiple job crystals.

In times of peace, crystal warriors are free to do as they please; however, when a new Scourge arises, they are the only ones that can do battle with it and its heralds. It can be a shock to some crystal warriors to find out that the fate of the world rests on their shoulders.

## SCOURGE

After each defeat, the Scourge lies dormant, reforming and building its strength over generations. Once the Scourge is close to reawakening, it sends out heralds to gather information and start setting plans into motion. The appearance of these heralds also signals to the people of the Reflection that a new Scourge is at hand, and the crystal warriors must be brought together.

The Scourge is different every time it appears, but there are common visual themes. Work with your players to decide these themes. They might include a cold aura, multiple eyes, aquatic adaptations, or a humanoid form.

You can use the below table to randomly generate the unique elements of the Scourge's latest manifestation:

## SCOURGE'S ELEMENT

| Undeath    |   5 | Fire   |   9 | Divine     |
|------------|-----|--------|-----|------------|
| Time       |   6 | Cold   |  10 | Water      |
| Corruption |   7 | Storm  |  11 | Space      |
| Poison     |   8 | Earth  |  12 | Technology |

## ROLE OF CRYSTALS

Job crystals are magical artifacts that contain knowledge about how to perform specific tasks. Attuning to such a crystal grants access to that knowledge, and repeated use of a job crystal allows the attuned person to access the full depths of knowledge stored inside.

Anyone can attune to a job crystal. A blacksmith might use one to gain access to schematics from an age long past, or a former tax collector could start a new life as a doctor, completely dependent on the job crystal to do anything.

Unknown to most of the Reflection's inhabitants, job crystals are formed from people that are defeated by the Scourge and its heralds.

## MAGIC AND AETHER

Everything in this Reflection is filled with aetheric energy. Aether is one of the key forces of the world, like gravity. There are many types of aether - called aspects - including fire, cold, light, dark, and many others.

Living creatures contain many of these different aetheric aspects at once, which come together to form a stable balance in their bodies. From this natural aether, and the aether in the air, magical effects can be produced.

Most living creatures are sensitive to aetheric imbalances in their body, and these imbalances can cause illness or even death. Fortunately, effects that quickly alter aetheric balances are rare. Elementals, celestials, and other creatures are much more sensitive to even minor imbalances, as their bodies are entirely made of aether.

## RUINS

The Eldeen Empire once ruled the world, pioneers of technology and magic. The empire's inventions were astounding, many centuries beyond what anyone can do today.

Eventually, however, the Eldeen Empire fell into ruin. Scholars don't share a consensus on the catalyst for this downfall, or if there were many catalysts. Regardless, all that's left now are the ruins of the once-great empire.

Eldeen ruins are found all over the world, including inhospitable places like beneath the ocean, inside volcanoes, and even on the moon. These ruins can be incredibly dangerous due to their defenses, the projects their occupants were working on, or even the locations in which they were built; however, every scrap of knowledge brought back from the depths of an Eldeen ruin is incredibly valuable.

## THEMES

Cycles: This Reflection is shaped around the inevitable cycle of the Scourge's rise and fall. The Scourge emerges, causes destruction and chaos, is defeated by crystal warriors, recedes into the background for just long enough to be forgotten, and arises once more.

Sacrifice: Crystal warriors have a duty to stand against the Scourge, as only a crystal warrior can defeat it. Unbeknownst to most, however, those crystal warriors defeated by the Scourge or its heralds eventually become job crystals themselves. In addition, whichever crystal warrior deals the blow that defeats the Scourge is automatically sacrificed, their life essence drawn from their body and used to 'destroy' the Scourge. Essentially, their body becomes a large job crystal, which then serves as the host for the next Scourge.

This is why crystal warriors are - unknown to them - so important to the Scourge. It wants the strongest warriors to fight it, so that if it is defeated, it can use their killer's body and skills as its next host.

Accept or Defy Fate: Many stories about crystal warriors revolve around them discovering and coping with the fact that at least one of them will die defeating the Scourge. Those that look for an alternative might discover the dark truth about the cycle, and instead look for ways to break the cycle altogether. Either way, the Scourge has to be dealt with, and time is ticking.

## DETAILS

In this Reflection, magic and magitech are widely available. Airships, trains, and other fantastical elements are common, and amazing structures have been built in ages both past and present.

Because of the widespread availability of magic, technology, and job crystals, communities can grow large and take care of the people who live within them.

This Reflection is designed around the 'rule of cool' . Don't worry about realism and physics - just focus on telling engaging stories full of cool things.

## COLOSSUS

## SUMMARY

The denizens of Reflection: Colossus live in cities built into the bodies of massive, wandering mechanical beings - the colossi. One of these colossi has begun to attack other colossi, and the beacons - the very dreams of the colossi - must face this danger.

## BEACONS

Beacons are the dreams of the colossi. When a colossus faces a serious obstacle or problem, they draw upon their stores of crystals to manifest a solution from their dreams in the form of a beacon.

Beacons have unique connections to the colossi that dreamt them, but they are their own independent entities. Some beacons rebel against the task they were created for, while others embrace it.

Colossi don't create beacons lightly. Once a beacon is created, they have no control over their agent, and no way to reclaim the resources used to create them.

## SCOURGE

The colossi roam the world, searching for deposits of crystals that they consume for energy. One colossus has learned that it is easier to attack other colossi than hunt for food alone. This is the Scourge.

This colossus is known as 'the City of the Dead' , for the massive city built into their body. No living creatures can be found in this city, and legends hold that the colossus killed their own inhabitants when they dared to try to gain control of it.

## ROLE OF CRYSTALS

Crystals are a source of food and energy for the colossi. These beings consume as much as they can, which seems to be passively absorbed by the magics and machinery that make up their body. Many cities are home to crystal hunters - people that seek out large deposits to which they can lead their colossus.

## MAGIC AND AETHER

Magic is rare in this Reflection and requires crystals to fuel spells. Using magic is a long, complicated, and laborious process, and since it uses the same crystals that the colossi eat, the people living on them are hesitant to use them.

Beacons, however, are innately magical and can easily use magic. Spells that would require a team of regular arcanists can be cast with a wave of a beacon's hand.

## RUINS

Abandoned colossi and those returning from the underground are the ruins of this Reflection. Beacons are needed to ensure each colossus is safe for settlement.

## THEMES

Journey: The movements of the colossi are unpredictable, and the people that live atop them are subject to their whims. Colossi occasionally burrow underground, where they can go missing for years or even centuries, before rising again from the underworld.

Dreams: Beacons are formed from the dreams of the colossi, so dreams and the meanings of dreams are important themes in this Reflection.

Purpose: Beacons are created for specific purposes. What happens when that purpose is fulfilled, or what happens if someone can't or won't accomplish the task for which they were created?

## DETAILS

Most of the time, each beacon is from their own colossus, although it is possible for multiple PCs to be from the same one.

When the players describe and introduce their characters, ask them to also describe the colossus that dreamt them, and the problem they were dreamt to solve.

## THE SOUL GUARD

## SUMMARY

Dangerous monsters arise constantly from the Mistlands, a place saturated with the souls of those killed in a long-forgotten cataclysm. One group - the Soul Guard - trains to fight these monsters and protect the last standing city, Novissimum.

## BEACONS

The leading members of the Soul Guard are the beacons of this Reflection. Each beacon leads a branch of the Soul Guard. Each of these branches has its own specialty, whether it be city defense, research, or Mistland expeditions.

## SCOURGE

Based on what the Soul Guard has learned, the Scourge is an intelligent creature from the Mistlands that seeks to cause another cataclysm. By doing so, it hopes to expand the borders of the Mistlands.

In truth, however, the Scourge's motivations are deeper than what they have been told. It will take everything the heroes of the Soul Guard have to find the truth.

## ROLE OF CRYSTALS

Crystals are one of the only things that keep back the mist from the Mistlands. The largest crystals are built into the walls of Novissimum, keeping a wide area safe. Crystal posts have been placed along a few roads to improve visibility, but they're not strong enough to keep the monsters away.

## MAGIC AND AETHER

The mist from the Mistlands has a dampening effect on aether, making it harder to use. Monsters are also highly resistant to magic, their skin immediately dispersing weak spells.

To counteract this, the Soul Guard uses weapons infused with incredibly high levels of aether. The aetheric density of these weapons makes them able to pierce monstrous defenses, and mages can use these weapons as foci that enhance their spells to the point where they can harm monsters.

## RUINS

The Mistlands are pocketed with ruins from the cataclysm. The closest ruins are abandoned sections of the Novissimum, lost to the mist. However, deeper in the Mistlands reside ruins from other cities, whose history tells a different story than the Soul Guard were lead to believe.

## THEMES

Survival: Stories in this Reflection start with a focus on the threat of the Mistlands - either the monsters that come from within or the dangers of exploring it.

Responsibility: As leaders of the Soul Guard, the beacons have to cope with the challenges of politics and bureaucracy, which intensify as they discover the truth about the cataclysm, the Mistlands, and the history of Novissimum.

The Past: The inhabitants of the Novissimum have been told a misleading or false history. The true nature of their world's past is for the GM to decide, but important powers want to keep that past buried.

## DETAILS

Novissimum is the final bastion of civilization - the only known urban structure to survive the calamity that nearly destroyed this Reflection. Beyond the walls of the city lie the Mistlands, an endless landscape filled with dangerous horrors.

The truth of this Reflection's history lies in the Mistlands. Troubling clues are being brought into the light as the Scourge puts its plans into motion.

The exact history of this Reflection is for each group to decide, but one truth is this: The city is not alone, and the actions its people took during the calamity were not as benign as history says.

## DESIGNING A HUB

Once you've designed your Reflection, the next step is to create a Hub for the beacons. The Hub will be their base of operations - something like a guildhall, personal airship, or castle. It provides them with a place to rest, repair equipment, and replenish their resources.

It's important for the beacons to have a Hub because this game assumes they will always have access to resources between quests. They don't need to worry about maintaining access to their unlocked equipment and abilities - they're always available at the Hub.

The Hub also serves as a great way to introduce friendly NPCs, like a blacksmith who can repair weapons or a cheerful treasurer who makes sure the beacons can fund their adventures.

The players and GM build the Hub together: the players make several decisions as a group, and the GM provides guidance and answers questions.

## STARTING WITHOUT A HUB

You can decide to delay the acquisition of a Hub so the beacons don't start with one; however, the GM should make sure the beacons get one as soon as possible.

## BUILDING THE HUB

Designing a Hub involves choosing features , drawbacks , and a theme . These describe important parts of the Hub, and help the players understand how the Hub looks and fits into the Reflection. These aspects are intentionally open-ended so that the players and GM can fill out the details themselves.

A well protected Hub, for example, could simply have sturdy walls, or it could have automated magitech guards patrolling at all times.

Begin by choosing two beneficial features for the hub from the list below or making your own.

|   FEATURES | FEATURES        |   FEATURES | FEATURES                |
|------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------------|
|          1 | Mobile          |          4 | Long history            |
|          2 | Well protected  |          5 | Highly valuable         |
|          3 | Secret location |          6 | Dedicated support staff |

Next, choose two drawbacks or make your own.

|   DRAWBACKS |   DRAWBACKS | DRAWBACKS                     |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
|           1 |           4 | Prone to monster infestations |
|           2 |           5 | Hard to get to                |
|           3 |           6 | Terrible reputation           |

Then choose a theme or make your own.

|   THEME | THEME      |    |           |
|---------|------------|----|-----------|
|       1 | Mechanical |  4 | Magical   |
|       2 | Natural    |  5 | Aquatic   |
|       3 | Urban      |  6 | Unnatural |

Finally, decide on a name for your Hub. Examples include:

- Ø the Cloudwalker
- Ø Skyhold
- Ø the Strolling Sands
- Ø the Ragnarok

## EXAMPLE HUB

The Cloudwalker is mobile and well protected , but has high operating costs and a terrible reputation . It has a mechanical theme.

The  Cloudwalker  is  an  old  combat  airship showing signs of its age. Its armor plates are rusty and stained, but still sturdy. Keeping an airship in the air is already expensive, and keeping a relic like the Cloudwalker in working condition is even more so.

In its history as a combat airship, the Cloudwalker was used in a number of terrible assaults. Its distinctive silhouette brings fear to those who see it and remember the horrors it once brought.

## HUB UPGRADES

The Hub can be upgraded during your game to improve it or make it feel more like home. Some upgrades provide narrative benefits, like the café , while others provide mechanical benefits, like the runeforge . Some example Hub upgrades are provided below, but the GM can also create custom upgrades to suit the needs of the players.

Each upgrade has a GOLD cost to acquire it, and some can be enhanced (for a price) to improve their effects. Some can even be enhanced multiple times. The descriptions list the increased benefits of enhanced up-

ENHANCE

During  each  downtime,  each  PC  can  wager  any amount of GOLD and roll 1d6. On a 1-3, they lose the GOLD wagered.  On  a  4-6,  they  win,  keeping their wager and gaining an equal amount of GOLD .

This can be done multiple times per downtime, but every time the range of win results decreases by 1 (from 4-6 to 5-6, then 6).

The casino can be enhanced  once,  which increases the starting range to win by 1 (from 4-6 to 3-6).

grades with a slash. For example, '2/3/4' means that the upgrade begins at 2 and can be enhanced to 3, then 4.

The beacons can pool their GOLD together to purchase upgrades and enhancements. The GM may also allow for other forms of payment or cost reductions. For example, if the beacons save a blacksmith's life, the GM might allow them to reduce the cost of the forge upgrade by -2 GOLD , if they can convince that blacksmith to join them.

## TELLING YOUR STORY

By this point, you will have completed session 0. With your Reflection and Hub decided, you're ready to play the game. Next, everyone creates their characters (see p. 11) and then you can start to tell your story!

## BUILDING CAMPAIGNS

Your campaign is the greater story that you and your players are playing through together, usually set on a single Reflection. All the quests, narrative scenes, and combat scenes you and your players will experience are part of this campaign.

Most campaigns revolve around confronting their Reflection's Scourge. This might involve defeating it, sealing it away, or even trying to break the cycle of the Scourge forever.

When you create your Reflection in Session 0, you will probably start formulating ideas for the outline of a campaign. Keep those discussions in mind as you plan out the details of the campaign.

This section presents some tips for building a campaign and the quests that make it up.

## LENGTH

When planning a campaign, think about how long you want it to last. Because character levels are tied to quests, they're a great way to measure campaign length.

Are you and the players looking for a short commitment? Maybe plan on playing for 3-6 character levels. A longer campaign can go all the way up to level 12.

While it's possible to go up to level 12, your campaign doesn't need to last this long. It's perfectly possible to tell a story in a shorter time frame, and most characters can feel complete well before level 12.

## STARTING POINT

Next, consider what level you want the beacons to start at. By default, they start at level 1, and this is recommended for new players; however, if you have an experienced group, they might want to start at a higher level, and that's fine.

It's important to note that higher levels in BEACON doesn't necessarily equate to stronger characters. Higher-level beacons do get more ability points and GRIT , but mostly they just get more options and complexity, not raw power. Even at level 1, beacons are heroes. They're the main characters. A low level doesn't automatically mean they're untrained commoners.

## CHARACTER CONNECTIONS

Incorporate elements from your PCs' background skills into the campaign. Tie these characters and their stories to the broader story of the campaign, and keep doing so throughout.

Each story beat that takes place in the campaign should be connected to at least one of the PCs.

## ONE STEP AT A TIME

You don't need to plan out your entire campaign ahead of time. It's good to have a rough outline of where you might want it to go, but planning out every beat ahead of time can sometimes be a hindrance.

During the course of your campaign, your players will take actions that deviate from your planned story. That's fine! It's completely normal, and happens in most campaigns. That's why you don't want to waste time and energy planning out every step of the campaign ahead of time, because you will have to change those plans at some point anyway.

Plan a few steps or levels ahead, stay flexible, and have an outline of where you want the story to go next.

## BUILDING QUESTS

BEACON revolves around quests . The protagonists of your story will undergo a series of quests, pursuing their goals across both narrative and combat play. After each quest, they have a period of downtime before going on the next one.

Quests are like chapters in a story, with combats as the high-action peaks of that story. Quests usually contain one to four combat scenes, with narrative scenes sprinkled throughout.

Quests should always further the main campaign, even if not directly. Perhaps a seemingly unrelated quest allows the beacons to learn an important fact about the Scourge, or help them take out an important agent of the Scourge.

## QUEST STAGES

A story typically has four stages: an inciting incident , rising action , a climax , and then the conclusion .  This is a useful framework for planning quests. All you need to do is come up with ideas for each of those four stages, and then figure out where your one to four combat scenes fit in:

- Ø Inciting incident: This is the catchy introduction to the quest's story, which coincides nicely with the beacons' preparations for the quest. You might either tell the players what's going on, or use cutscenes to explain the situation.
- Ø Rising action: This is the buildup of the story, defined by ever-escalating stakes and tension. Each scene builds on those that have come before. This is usually the longest part of the quest, and where most combat scenes happen.
- Ø Climax: This is the highest point of the story - the culmination of all the prior scenes. The climax is often a final fight or confrontation.
- Ø Conclusion: This is the wrap-up of the story, where the repercussions of the beacons' actions shine through. This usually leads directly into downtime.

## QUEST IDEAS

Here are some simple ideas that you can use or modify for your own quests. Each quest contains examples for each of the four quest stages identified above.

## Dug Too Deep

Summary: Some miners dug too deep, and now the mine is swarming with monsters.

Inciting Incident: The miners unearthed a hole with no bottom. When they sent someone to explore, their animated skeleton was the only thing that returned. Monsters began to appear in the mine and the miners reported hallucinations before they abandoned it altogether.

- Rising Action: The PCs must venture into the bottomless pit and deal with the source of these monsters or find a way to plug the hole for good.
- Climax: The beacons must evade a giant monster, riding mine carts in a thrilling chase before the collapsing mine traps them inside!
- Conclusion: The mine's closed for good, but that's probably a good thing considering the size of the monster that chased the beacons.

## Escort Cargo

- Summary: Eris Brittam, a historian and collector of antiques, needs a shipment of important cargo to be protected during transport.
- Inciting Incident: A group of pirates recently attacked the shipment. The next stage of the journey is the most dangerous, and the pirates will definitely attack again. The cargo will next be loaded onto an airship or train.
- Rising Action: The beacons must fend off numerous pirate attacks. As the cargo gets closer to its destination, the pirates grow more desperate.
- Climax: Runaway train/ship! If the pirates can't have the cargo, no one can! The beacons must defeat the pirate leader and regain control of the train/ ship before it crashes!
- Conclusion: The beacons see what happens when the cargo reaches its destination and are rewarded by Eris Brittam.

## Kidnapped Royal

Summary: A prince or princess has been captured and must be rescued! The royal family has an idea who might have done it, but the real reason might be surprising …

Inciting Incident: The beacons arrive at the castle the morning after the royal was kidnapped. The castle is in a state of panic as they search for the missing person, and no one will deal with the beacons until they are returned.

Rising Action: The beacons identify the kidnapper and where they went. They must make their way to where the royal is being held before the kidnapper can escape.

Climax: The beacons confront the kidnapper. If the kidnapper was in the wrong, the beacons must fight them and their companions. If the situation is more complicated, they must confront the true threat.

Conclusion: The beacons are rewarded by whoever they supported, and are offered support in their next task.

## Kill the Dungeon

Summary: A living, growing dungeon has been unearthed. Its rooms expand like tree roots, weakening the ground and releasing monsters onto the surface. It must be stopped.

Inciting Incident: Monster attacks have been on the rise lately, but with no obvious source. One day a sinkhole swallows up part of a city, revealing an expanding dungeon beneath. Architects confirm that where the dungeon is now, there once were sewers. The dungeon is growing.

Rising Action: The beacons venture into the dungeon, encountering the monsters and traps that spawn inside of it. They find signs of the life and intelligence that is the dungeon itself.

Climax: The dungeon focuses its ability to create monsters to forging a powerful body for itself. This living manifestation of the dungeon clashes with the beacons, attempting to purge its body of the invading heroes!

Conclusion: If the beacons win, they can kill the dungeon and stop it from growing any further. If they lose, it will grow unchecked.

## Night of the Dead

Summary: A town is under siege by the undead, who rise every night but turn to ash when the sun rises.

Inciting Incident: The beacons receive a direct request for aid from the townsfolk. The people of the town need help identifying the source of the undead invasion and putting a stop to it. They lose more people every night and will soon be overrun.

Rising Action: The beacons help the townsfolk temporarily strengthen their defenses, then go hunting for the source of the undead. They trace it back to the shadowy forest nearby.

Climax: The beacons make their way through the forest to confront the foul necromancer, a powerful young mage who was exiled from the town as a child.

Conclusion: The beacons either defeat the necromancer or convince them to stop. The townsfolk are relieved to be safe once more.

## Remove the Corruption

Summary: A corrupt political leader has been rallying the populace against the beacons and their efforts.

Inciting Incident: The corrupt leader calls for the imprisonment of the beacons. A mob of deceived citizens attack the beacons.

Rising Action: The beacons have to avoid drawing attention to themselves. They must figure out how to remove the corrupt leader and get proof of their corruption.

Climax: The corrupt leader reveals their master plan in a villainous monologue, and sets their lackeys upon the beacons! The heroes must capture them before they can destroy the evidence.

Conclusion: If the beacons get the evidence, they can regain their good standing. If not, they are forever branded as outlaws and criminals.

## BUILDING COMBAT SCENES

There are a number of decisions a GM has to make when preparing a combat scene. For example, they need to:

- Ø decide how difficult the combat will be (p. 243)
- Ø create a battle map for the combat and populate it with terrain features
- Ø decide on the combat's battle plan (p. 244). For example, is it a simple Elimination scene in which the PCs just have to defeat all the enemies, or is it more involved, like an Assassination scene?
- Ø decide how many NPCs will be in the combat scene, what their NPC types are, and whether they have any templates (p. 259).

The rest of this section covers these decision points, and Chapter 11: Non-Player Characters (p. 259) contains the full list of NPCs, templates, and their rules.

## SCENE DIFFICULTY

A combat scene's difficulty is one way for a GM to customize a fight. The main way to adjust a combat's difficulty is by increasing or decreasing the number of enemies within it.

The first step in deciding how many NPCs should be present in a combat scene is to determine your NPC budget .  T o do this, take the number of PCs that will be participating in the fight and multiply that number by 1.5. For example, if you have 4 PCs, your NPC budget will be 6 (4 × 1.5 = 6).

## NPC budget = # of PCs × 1.5

Certain battle plans will modify this NPC budget. The Survival battle plan, for example, doubles your NPC budget. If your normal NPC budget would be 6, for example, it would be doubled to 12 in a Survival combat scene.

Every NPC you add to a combat scene costs some points from the NPC budget. Most NPCs cost 1 point to add to a scene, but NPCs with certain templates, like Minions or Mini-Bosses, cost different amounts.

| NPC BUDGET COSTS   | NPC BUDGET COSTS   |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1 Minion NPC       | 0.25 points        |
| 4 Minion NPCs      | 1 point            |
| 1 NPC              | 1 point            |
| 1 Veteran NPC      | 1.5 points         |
| 1 Elite NPC        | 2 points           |
| 1 Mini-Boss NPC    | 3 points           |

If an NPC has multiple templates with different costs (e.g., an Elite Veteran), just take the highest cost.

Using fewer NPCs than your NPC budget allows for will result in easier combat scenes, while going over your budget will result in harder combat scenes.

Other factors can also change the difficulty of a combat scene:

- Ø If there are more PCs than there are NPCs, the PCs have a huge advantage because of the number of turns available to them versus the NPCs. Try to design combat scenes so there aren't many more PCs than NPCs.
- Ø Minions are easily defeated, but do just as much damage as standard NPCs. Too many Minions can quickly overwhelm the PCs.
- Ø Mini-Bosses shouldn't fight the PCs alone. Any single character, even a Mini-Boss, is quickly overwhelmed by multiple opponents.

Ultimately, figuring out what counts as an easy, normal, or hard combat scene is more art than science because there are just so many variables. A combat scene that seems hard on paper might be very easy for your players because their builds counter the NPCs you picked. The more you play with your group and the more familiar you become with their characters, the more accurately you'll be able to achieve your intended difficulty.

## MAPMAKING

Combat scenes take place on a battle map , a special type of gridded map that traditionally uses square or hex spaces. You can use either type of spaces for BEACON , since the game is measured in spaces of any type. 1 space can be either 1 square or 1 hex.

This section provides guidance on how to make a fun battle map, from choosing the correct size to populating it with interesting features.

## Map Size

The size of the map often varies from scene to scene:

- Ø Smaller maps usually  have  a  longest  side  of approximately 20 spaces.
- Ø Standard-sized maps  have  a  longest  side  of approximately 25 spaces
- Ø Larger  maps usually  have  a  longest  side  of approximately 40 spaces.

Battle plans other than Elimination assume a map with a longest side of 40 spaces or less. They can be used with smaller or larger maps, but certain battle plans might be easier or harder with different map sizes.

## Map Features

Combat scenes should take place in interesting places with interesting features, not small, featureless rooms.

Here are some tips for building interesting combat scenes:

- Ø Add sections of soft and/or hard cover. Tables, trees, walls, and other elements can all be cover.
- Ø Add obstacles or large pieces of terrain to block line of sight.
- Ø Add places on the map that beacons can get bonuses for reaching - regaining RECOVERIES , HP , or MP ; getting a reroll on the next loot crate; and so on.
- Ø Spice things up with environmental factors and terrain features.
- Ø Create zones that provide tactical options for players. Getting from point A to point B might involve crossing an open field and being vulnerable to a Sharpshooter NPC. Consider adding an alternative route that is longer but protected from enemy fire.
- Ø Mix up the size and width of pathways.

## BATTLE PLAN

Each combat scene has a battle plan . Battle plans provide the framework for combat scenes, determining the win conditions for the PCs, the NPC budget, and any special rules. These are designed to make combat scenes more engaging than just  'destroy all enemies' . Many battle plans feature solutions that allow scenes to be resolved quickly.

In the absence of another battle plan, combat scenes default to Elimination (see below).

## Terminology

- Ø Control Zone: Certain battle plans feature control zones, which are areas on the battlefield that PCs and NPCs must fight over.
- Ø Deployment Zone: In scenes that have them, PCs and NPCs start within their respective deployment zones. Not every battle plan has deployment zones.
- Ø Escape Zone: PCs can use escape zones to leave a combat scene. Battle plans that feature escape zones explain how they're used.
- Ø Reinforcements: Reinforcements are characters that join a combat scene after the first round.
- Ø Reinforcement Zone: NPC reinforcements enter the combat scene within reinforcement zones.
- Ø Objectives: Objectives are characters, objects, or zones that the PCs must interact with in certain ways. Objectives don't take turns. They automatically fail all checks or saves, and clear all conditions, effects, and statuses at the start of each round.

## Elements

Every battle plan contains the following elements, which shape how the combat scene plays out.

- Ø Map: Every battle plan contains an example map. This map is meant to represent how the combat scene should be laid out and can be used as a starting point when creating an actual battle map.
- Ø Goal: The goal is whatever the PCs must do to achieve victory in the combat scene. Some battle plans  have  secondary  goals,  which  must  be completed after the primary goal to secure victory.
- Ø Setup: The setup provides recommendations on how the combat scene should be laid out.
- Ø Rules: Some battle plans have special rules. This section explains how they work.
- Ø NPC Prep: This describes how many NPCs the GM should prepare and whether or not there are reinforcements. In addition, it indicates whether the PCs or NPCs deploy first in the combat scene. Whichever side deploys first must decide where in their deployment zones they want to start without knowing the locations of their opponents.
- Ø Reinforcements: This  outlines  when  enemy reinforcements join the combat scene, and where from.

## Acqusition

The beacons have to fight through enemies toward a location, and then keep their foes out. These combat scenes often involve securing a person or location held by enemy forces.

Goal: Have more PCs than enemy NPCs in the control zone at the end of Round 6.

<!-- image -->

Setup: Place a PC deployment zone along one edge of the map. Place a control zone near the opposite side of the map. This control zone is also the NPC deployment zone. It should be fortified with cover and large enough for multiple characters to occupy at the same time. Place reinforcement zones along the edges of the map.

Rules: At the end of Round 6, determine if there are more enemy NPCs in the control zone than PCs. Mini-Bosses count as 4 characters each, Elites count as 2, Minions count as 1/4, and Summons count as 0.

NPC Prep: Normal NPC budget, but half are reinforcements . NPCs deploy first.

Reinforcements: At the end of Round 1, the GM deploys all reinforcements in any reinforcement zones.

## Assassination

An important target has been identified and must be eliminated. Once this is done, the beacons have to safely escape.

Goal: Defeat the objective by the end of Round 8.

<!-- image -->

Secondary Goal: Defeat all enemy NPCs or escape.

Setup: Enemy NPCs can deploy anywhere on the map. Place a PC deployment zone along one edge of the map and place the objective anywhere on the map, ideally far from the PC deployment zone. Next, place an escape zone somewhere on the map, typically between the PC deployment zone and the objective. Reinforcement zones are located throughout the map, either along the edge or at locations where allies of the objective can appear, like houses or barracks.

Rules: The objective is a Veteran or Elite NPC. They should not be a Mini-Boss. When acting, they prioritize survival. Only the PCs can escape. They can do so as a free action at the end of their turn while partly inside the escape zone. After defeating the objective, the combat scene only ends when either:

- Ø all enemy NPCs are defeated
- Ø all undefeated PCs escape
- Ø all PCs are defeated.

NPC Prep: 2.5 x NPC budget, but half are reinforcements . NPCs deploy first.

Reinforcements: At the start of any round before the target is defeated, the GM can deploy up to four Minions or up to two other NPCs in any reinforcement zones. Once the target is defeated, no more reinforcements appear.

## Control

The beacons must hold locations of strategic importance like mines, food stores, or barracks.

Goal: Have more points than the NPCs at the end of Round 5.

<!-- image -->

Setup: Place a PC deployment zone and an NPC deployment zone along opposite edges of the map. The NPC deployment zone should be larger than the PC deployment zone and is also a reinforcement zone. Place four control zones, evenly spaced between the PC and NPC deployment zones.

Rules: At the end of each round, determine if either side controls any control zones. Control zones are controlled if one side has more characters in the zone than the other side, excluding Summons . Each side gets 1 point for every zone it controls. If either side controls all four zones, it gains +1 point.

At the end of Round 6, the team with the most points wins.

NPC Prep: 2 x NPC budget, but half are reinforcements . Roll a d6. On a 1-3, the NPCs deploy first.

Reinforcements: At the start of any round, the GM can deploy up to four Minions or up to two other NPCs in any reinforcement zones.

## Defense

The beacons must protect someone or something from hostile forces that want them (or it) dead.

Goal: Protect the objective until the end of Round 5. If the objective is defeated or destroyed, the PCs automatically lose.

<!-- image -->

Setup: Place a PC deployment zone near the center of the map, fortified with cover. Additionally, place an NPC deployment zone around the edge of the map. This is also a reinforcement zone.

Place the objective inside the PC deployment zone.

Rules: The objective is a character or object with the following attributes:

SIZE 1/2 to 2 , HP 25/30/35 , DODGE / A-DEF 10

The enemy NPCs should focus on attacking the objective. If the objective is a character or object that can be moved, then when a character begins their standard movement adjacent to it, the objective moves along with that character. At the end of that movement, the player can place the objective in any adjacent free space. If the objective is adjacent to two characters from different sides, it stops moving and won't move further. The objective doesn't move on its own.

NPC Prep: Normal NPC budget. NPCs deploy after the PCs.

Reinforcements: If any NPCs are held as reinforcements, they can be deployed in reinforcement zones at the start of any round.

## Destruction

The beacons have a brief opportunity to destroy a number of objectives before time runs out.

Goal: Destroy all objectives before the end of Round 8. If any objectives remain at this time, the PCs automatically lose.

<!-- image -->

Setup: Place a PC deployment zone along one edge of the map. Then, place an NPC deployment zone near the opposite end of the map and reinforcement zones along the other edges of the map.

Scatter 1-5 objectives around the map, gravitating toward the NPC deployment zone.

Rules: The objectives are objects with the following attributes:

SIZE 1 to 2 , HP = see below, DODGE / A-DEF 5

To calculate the objectives' HP , multiply the number of PCs by 20 and divide this number evenly between the objectives. For example, with four PCs, the pool of HP is 80 . With two objectives, each has 40 HP . With four objectives, each has 20 HP .

The objectives do not clear Discord and they take any ongoing Discord damage at the end of each round.

NPC Prep: Slightly more than the normal NPC budget, but not more than twice the budget. NPCs over the normal budget are held as reinforcements . Enemy NPCs deploy first.

Reinforcements: At the start of any round, the GM can deploy up to four Minions or up to two other NPCs in any reinforcement zones.

## Elimination

Two or more sides must fight until their enemies are defeated or in rout.

Goal: Defeat all enemies.

<!-- image -->

Setup: Place a PC deployment zone and, if there are reinforcements, reinforcement zones anywhere on the map. NPCs can be deployed anywhere.

Rules: No special rules.

NPC Prep: Normal NPC budget. Roll a d6. On a 1-3, the NPCs deploy first. If the PCs deploy first, don't surround them with NPCs - place them in interesting places, instead.

Reinforcements: If any NPCs are held as reinforcements, any number of them can be deployed in reinforcement zones at the start of a round.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Escort

The beacons seek to escort someone through enemy lines. The enemy forces want this person for themselves, and will try to take them or prevent the beacons from moving them.

Goal: Escape with the objective before the end of Round 8.

<!-- image -->

Setup: Place a PC deployment zone along one edge of the map and an escape zone on the opposite edge. Next, place an NPC deployment zone between the PC deployment zone and the escape zone, and reinforcement zones along the other edges of the map.

Rules: The objective is a character with these attributes:

SIZE 1/2 to 2 , HP = 10 × SIZE (MIN 10), DODGE / A-DEF 10

Enemy NPCs should not willingly attack or damage the objective.

When a character begins their standard movement adjacent to the objective, the objective moves along with them. At the end of that movement, the player can place the objective in any adjacent free space. If the objective is adjacent to two characters from different sides, the objective stops moving, won't move further, and they are considered contested . The objective doesn't move on their own.

Only PCs can escape. They can do so as a free action at the end of their turn while partly within the escape zone. The objective escapes if they are adjacent to a PC that escapes and aren't contested.

NPC Prep: 2 × NPC budget, but half are held as reinforcements . NPCs deploy after the PCs. The PCs deploy the objective in their deployment zone when they deploy.

Reinforcements: At the start of any round, the GM can deploy up to four Minions or one other NPC in any reinforcement zone.

## Holdout

The beacons need to hold the line against unending waves of enemies, preventing their foes from overwhelming the space they control.

Goal: At the end of Round 6, there are fewer enemy NPCs (excluding Summons ) in the control zone than there were PCs at the beginning of the combat scene.

<!-- image -->

Setup: Place a PC deployment zone near the center of the map. This is also the control zone and should be fortified with cover. The edges of the map are both the NPC deployment zone and the reinforcement zone.

Rules: Defeated NPC units (excluding Mini-Bosses) return as reinforcements after a number of rounds equal their WOUND CAP .

NPC Prep: 3 + NPC budget. NPCs beyond the budget are held as reinforcements. NPCs deploy after PCs.

Reinforcements: At the start of each round after the first, the GM can deploy all reinforcements in the reinforcement zone.

## Raid

In a raid, the beacons rush to collect something, whether it be strategic resources or vital information.

Goal: End Round 4, 5, or 6 with X treasure, where X = the number of PCs +1.

<!-- image -->

Setup: Place a PC deployment zone and an NPC deployment zone on opposite edges of the map, and 1-4 reinforcement zones along the other edges. Distribute chests equal to twice the number of PCs around the map.

Rules: While in the space of a chest, PCs can open it as a minor action . Some chests might be locked. When a PC opens a chest, they gain 1 treasure.

Characters can hold any amount of treasure at once. Whenever a character holding treasure takes a Wound or Overstress, they drop all their treasure in an adjacent space of their choice. They can also willingly drop all their treasure as a minor action . Characters can pick up all treasure in a space they occupy as a minor action .

Enemy NPCs don't open chests, but will pick up dropped treasure.

NPC Prep: Normal NPC budget. NPCs deploy after the PCs.

Reinforcements: If any NPCs are held as reinforcements, any number of them can be deployed in reinforcement zones at the start of a round.

## Rescue

The beacons must fight their way to someone in need of rescue and safely escape with them.

Goal: Escape with the objective before the end of Round 10.

<!-- image -->

Setup: Place a PC deployment zone along one edge of the map. This is also the escape zone. Next, place an NPC deployment zone on the opposite side of the map, surrounded by cover and fortifications. Place reinforcement zones along the other edges of the map and the objective in the NPC deployment zone.

Rules: The objective is a character with these attributes:

SIZE 1/2 to 2 , HP = 10 × SIZE (MIN 10), DODGE / A-DEF 10

Enemy NPCs will not willingly attack or damage the objective.

When a character begins their standard movement adjacent to the objective, the objective moves along with them. At the end of that movement, the player can place the objective in any adjacent free space. If the objective is adjacent to two characters from different sides, the objective stops moving, won't move further, and they are considered contested . The objective doesn't move on their own.

Only the PCs can escape. They can do so as a free action at the end of their turn while partly inside the escape zone. The objective escapes if they are adjacent to a PC that escapes and aren't contested.

## ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND TERRAIN FEATURES

An interesting environment is a key part of a memorable combat scene. This section outlines a range of environmental factors and terrain features you can use in combat scenes, including the basic ones discussed earlier in the book.

## Environmental Factors

Environmental factors are effects that alter combat scenes, individual spaces, or even objects. Some apply to the entire combat scene, while others affect characters in smaller areas, such as in the case of a room with poor visibility.

## COLD

When characters within this environment take Stress from other characters, they take -1 Stress . When they take Lunar from other characters, they take +1 Lunar .

## HEAT

When characters within this environment take Stress from other characters, they take an additional +1 Stress . When they take Astral from other characters, they take +1 Astral .

## HIGH WINDS

At the start of each round, the GM chooses one side of the map. The winds are blowing in this direction. At the start of each character's turn while within this environment, they are pushed 1 space in the indicated direction, or 1d6 spaces if they are FLYING .

## LOCKS

Doors, gates, and treasure chests can all be locked, preventing them from being opened. A locked entrance - a bolted door, for instance - can't be moved through. The contents of chests and other objects that are locked can't be accessed.

To unlock something, you can make an AGILITY check as part of the action to interact with it. On a success, the lock is disabled and the object is opened.

## LOW GRAVITY

Characters in low-gravity environments can jump further than normal. When they begin their standard movement or begin a RUSH movement while within this environment, they can choose to gain FLYING , and can move up to half their SPEED in a straight line in addition to that movement. They lose FLYING at the end of that movement.

## LOW VISIBILITY

Low visibility can represent darkness, fog, and other effects that make it hard to see. It affects how far characters can see, and makes it harder to find HIDDEN characters. Low visibility has the following effects:

- Ø Characters are INVISIBLE while HIDDEN .
- Ø SCOPE and the RANGE of all weapons are reduced by half. REACH and AOEs are not affected.

## MANA VORTEXES

Mana vortexes alter the cost of spells, making them more or less expensive. There are two types of mana zones:

- Ø Mana Field: Mana fields reduce the MP cost of all spells used within them by -1, to a minimum of 0.
- Ø Mana Void: Mana voids increase the MP cost of all spells used within them by +1. This even applies to spells that don't usually have a MP cost.

## POISONOUS

Characters must succeed on a BULK check at the start of each of their turns while within this environment or take 1 DISCORD .

## UNDERWATER/ZERO-GRAVITY

Combat scenes that take place completely underwater or in zero-gravity treat all characters as FLYING . However, unless they have flight or an Aquatic Adaptation (granted by certain abilities), they can't RUSH or shift .

## Terrain Features

Terrain features modify spaces and terrain on the battlefield. They are not objects unless specifically indicated otherwise. While they generally affect single spaces, multiple terrain features can be placed next to each other to create a continuous feature. For example, you can have a single space of lava as dangerous terrain, but you could also connect multiple lava spaces to create a lava flow, all of which count as the same piece of dangerous terrain.

## ARMOR RACK

Characters can use an adjacent armor rack as a minor action , gaining one of the following effects for the rest of the scene:

- Ø They gain +2 ARMOR .
- Ø They gain resistance to either Physical, Force, Astral, or Lunar .

By default, each armor rack can be used once per scene.

## BALLISTA

While characters are within a ballista's space, their ranged weapons gain +5 RANGE .

## BLESSED TERRAIN

Characters in blessed terrain gain +1 on attacks, checks, and saves.

## CATAPULT

While characters are within a catapult's space, their ranged and thrown weapon attacks gain Arcing .

## CHARGED TERRAIN

Characters that end their turn in charged terrain take 5 PIERCING ASTRAL ,  -1  for  every space they moved that turn.

## CHASM

Chasms have no ground beneath them, or ground so far away that characters entering them must expend great effort to return.

NonFLYING characters that fully enter a chasm immediately stop moving, take 2 STRESS , and end their turn if it was their turn. Characters that start their turn in a chasm can immediately use their standard movement to move to the nearest free non-chasm space. Otherwise, they suffer the effects of the chasm.

## COVER

See p. 50 for detailed information on cover.

## CREEPING TERRAIN

Any other type of terrain can be creeping terrain, allowing it to move at the start of each round. The GM determines how far creeping terrain can move, but 2-3 spaces is a good baseline.

## CURSED TERRAIN

Characters in cursed terrain receive +1 on attacks, checks, and saves.

## DAWN STONE

Dawn stones are immovable objects with DODGE 5 and 1 HP . They don't cause obstruction and are auto-hit by AOE effects.

Dawn stones emit BURST 2 zones around themselves that negate the effects of low visibility. If a dawn stone is destroyed, characters within the zone must succeed on a BULK check or be BLINDED until cleared.

## DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS TERRAIN

Difficult terrain is anything that slows movement, like mud, water, or thick grass. Difficult terrain has +1 movement cost.

Dangerous terrain is any type of terrain that can cause damage, like lava or thorns.

1/round , when you enter dangerous terrain or end your turn in it, you must make an ability check of the GM's choice. On a failure, you take 5 damage of any type or Stress based on the type of terrain.

## DUSK STONE

Dusk stones are immovable objects with DODGE 5 and 1 HP . They don't cause obstruction and are auto-hit by AOE effects.

Dusk stones emit BURST 2 zones around themselves that cause low visibility. If a dusk stone is destroyed, characters within the zone are INVISIBLE until the end of their next turn.

## EMPTY SPACE/FREE SPACE

A free space is a space that doesn't contain any characters or objects. Empty spaces, on the other hand, are more specific than free spaces. Empty spaces are those that don't contain any characters, objects, terrain, or terrain features.

Some abilities affect free spaces, while others will affect empty spaces only.

## ETHEREAL RIFT

Characters that enter an ethereal rift can move through obstructions and ignore ENGAGEMENT until the end of their next turn, but can't end their turn inside an obstruction.

## EXPLOSIVE ZONE

Explosive zones increase the size of AOEs. If an AOE would include any spaces of an explosive zone, the AOE's size is increased by +1. A LINE 10 AOE becomes LINE 11 , a CLOSE BLAST 2 AOE becomes CLOSE BLAST 3 , and so on.

## FLAMMABLE TERRAIN

When a character standing in flammable terrain takes Astral or an AOE that deals Astral hits a space of flammable terrain, the terrain ignites (along with any adjacent flammable terrain). Characters in connected spaces (including diagonally) of flammable terrain must make an AGILITY check. Failure: They take 5 DISCORD . Success: They take 3 DISCORD . Either way, the spaces then become dangerous terrain ( AGILITY , 5 ASTRAL ) until the end of the scene.

## FOCUS ZONE

Characters that start their turn in a focus zone take 3/4/5 STRESS if they don't use a spell that turn.

## FOG

Fog provides soft cover to characters fully within it.

## FRICTIONLESS TERRAIN

Characters that enter frictionless terrain or move while within it continue moving in a straight line until they hit an obstruction or character, or move out of the frictionless terrain. This is considered forced movement.

## FURY ZONE

Characters that start their turn in a fury zone take 3/4/5 STRESS if they don't attack with a weapon that turn.

## GROWING TERRAIN

Any other type of terrain can be growing terrain, causing it to grow by 1d3 spaces at the start of each round.

## HARPOON

Characters standing in a harpoon's space can use their standard action during any phase to make a ranged weapon attack against a target within RANGE 15 .

On Hit: The target takes 1D6+1 PIERCING PHYSICAL , loses FLYING , and cannot resume FLYING until this phase in the next round.

Harpoons must be reloaded after each use. They can be reloaded with a standard action during any phase, or are automatically reloaded if a character in its space reloads a weapon.

## HEALING FONT

Characters adjacent to a healing font can regain all HP as a minor action . Once used in this way, the healing font is expended.

## HIGH GROUND

High ground provides benefits that represent being at a higher elevation than other characters, similar to those received when FLYING . Characters standing on high ground gain the following benefits:

- Ø Non-thrown melee attacks against them from nonFLYING characters that aren't on high ground receive +2 .
- Ø They  neither  become ENGAGED by  nor  cause ENGAGEMENT to nonFLYING characters that aren't on high ground.
- Ø Their attacks gain +1 against nonFLYING character that aren't on high ground.

Accessing high ground sometimes requires special movement, like flying or climbing.

## HOLY GROUND

When characters in holy ground would regain HP, they regain twice as much HP instead. This does not apply to characters with the Undead or Vampiric templates.

## IMPASSABLE TERRAIN

Impassable terrain is any terrain, like a wall or a cliff, that cannot normally be traversed except by characters who possess a type of movement that allows them to do so, like flying or climbing. Some impassable terrain cannot be entered at all (e.g., a pillar that reaches up to the ceiling or the walls of an underground dungeon).

## MANA FONT

Characters adjacent to a mana font can regain all MP as a minor action . Once used in this way, the mana font is expended.

## MONSTER SPAWNER

Monster spawners are objects that continually summon NPC reinforcements at the start of each round until disabled. These reinforcements are not considered part of the NPC budget. Monster spawners can be disabled with a successful ability check of the GM's choice as a minor action .

By default, monster spawners can't be attacked or destroyed. At the GM's option, a spawner may have 10/15/20 HP and DODGE 6.

## NOXIOUS FUMES

Noxious fumes provide soft cover . Characters that start their turn in noxious fumes must succeed on a BULK check or take 1 DISCORD , or if they already have Discord , take Discord equal to their current Discord .

<!-- image -->

Pits are difficult-to-escape holes in the ground. Characters fully inside a pit can only move to adjacent pit spaces unless they are FLYING or can teleport . Characters within a pit can use their standard movement or RUSH to move to an adjacent non-pit space.

## SLIPPERY TERRAIN

Slippery terrain is difficult terrain . Characters that start their turn in slippery terrain must succeed on an AGILITY check or fall PRONE . Characters that ignore difficult terrain ignore this effect.

## STICKY TERRAIN

Sticky terrain is difficult terrain . Characters that start their turn in sticky terrain must succeed on a BULK check or be IMMOBILIZED .

## TELEPORT PAD

Teleport pads can be one-way or two-way:

- Ø One-Way: There  are  three  types  of  one-way teleport pads, which determine their effects. When a character enters the teleport pad's space, they experience the relevant effect:
- Ø They teleport to a specific space.
- Ø They teleport 1d6 spaces in  a  random direction.
- Ø They teleport 1d6 spaces in  a  specific direction.
- Ø Two-Way: Each two-way teleport pad is connected to another. When a character enters the teleport pad's space, they are teleported to the connected pad. If the other teleport pad is occupied, the teleport fails.

## TRAPS

Traps are interactable objects with the Trap tag (p. 65). While many Traps are PC or NPC abilities, you can use the following Traps to represent Traps already on the battlefield.

Condition: The triggering character gains a condition based on the type of Trap . IMMOBILIZED , SLOWED , and BLINDED are common.

Condition, Area: When triggered, all characters in a BURST 1 AOE must make a save of the GM's choice. Failure: They gain a condition, chosen when the Trap is set.

Damage: The triggering character takes 6/8/10 damage of any type, chosen when the Trap is set.

Damage, Area: When triggered, all characters in a BURST 1 AOE must make save of the GM's choice. Failure: The target takes 6/8/10 damage of any type, chosen when the Trap is set. Success: They take 3/4/5 damage instead.

## TREASURE CHEST

Treasure chests are objects that don't cause obstruction and that contain bonus effects for the players, chosen from the table below. Players always know the contents of chests. The GM can decide if the bonuses apply to the character that opened the chest or everyone on their team. Some bonuses provide immediate effects, while others provide delayed effects or permanent resources.

Chests can be accessed with a minor action while in their space, but might be locked (see the locked environmental feature).

## SAMPLE CHEST REWARDS

- 1 A reroll on the next loot crate's first slot. Subsequent instances of this bonus increase the slot that can be rerolled. For example, getting this reward twice means that you can reroll either the first or second slot.

## UNHOLY GROUND

When characters in unholy ground would regain HP , they regain half the HP instead. This does not apply to characters with the Undead or Vampiric templates.

## UPDRAFT

Characters in an updraft gain FLYING for as long as they are in an updraft, or until the end of their turn if they leave an updraft.

## WEAPON RACK

Characters can use an adjacent weapon rack as a minor action , choosing one of the following options:

- Ø They repair a destroyed weapon for free.
- Ø They gain +1 on all attacks with a weapon of their choice for the rest of the scene.

By default, each weapon rack can be used once per scene.

## INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY

Combat in BEACON is based around information transparency. Your goal as GM isn't to hide information from your players or trick them, but instead to allow them to make informed decisions.

During combat scenes, you should always share the following information with players:

- Ø The NPC types and templates for all enemies.
- Ø The locations of enemies on the map at all times, regardless of line of sight or whether they are HIDDEN or INVISIBLE .
- Ø The conditions and statuses of all enemies.
- Ø The battle plan and all relevant goals.
- Ø The locations of all Traps .
- Ø The mechanics of any abilities or items that NPCs use.

Other information is restricted unless a beacon has a specific way to access it. This includes the ability scores and attributes of NPCs and the specific features they have equipped. Certain abilities, like the LORE BOOK support item (p. 218), can provide access to restricted information.

## COMBAT SCENE TIPS

Combat scenes have a lot of moving parts. These including creating a fair, balanced, and interesting fight for the players; designing the battle map; and controlling the NPCs during the fight.

This section contains some general, helpful tips to keep in mind when creating combat scenes.

## MAKE THEM INTERESTING

Combat scenes should be more than just generic battles against faceless minions. There should be stakes, reasons for fighting, and environmental features that make them interesting.

An example of a boring combat scene would be a simple dungeon room with a bunch of animated skeletons guarding the exit. A more exciting example would have the beacons finding an underground mausoleum, in which a royal animated skeleton sits atop a bone throne and attacks anyone who enters with an endlessly spawning army of lesser skeletons. These foes can only be stopped if the beacons destroy their sarcophagi.

## KEEP PLAYERS ACTIVE

Depending on the actions players take each round, there can be a decent amount of time between their turns. Try to minimize situations that would take players out of a fight. Fill combat scenes with different things people can interact with so they have things to do other than just attacking enemies. Environmental factors, terrain features like high ground , and civilians in need of rescue are all examples of things between which players might need to split their focus.

## PLAY TO YOUR PLAYERS' STRENGTHS

There are a wide variety of NPC types that you can use, and some of them are strong against specific play styles.

When designing combat scenes, make sure to play to the strengths of the PCs, not their weaknesses. Use NPCs that counter PCs as a way to challenge them, not as a way to beat them. As a player, it always feels better to defeat an NPC than to feel like you aren't contributing anything.

## CHOOSE THE RIGHT SIZE AND TERRAIN

Every combat scene takes place on a battle map. The size of these maps may vary from scene to scene, but on average, they should be around 25 spaces by 25 spaces. This gives enough room for tight, efficient scenes.

Avoid combats in plain, open fields. Placing terrain and objects around the battlefield gives people opportunities to find cover and avoid line of sight.

BuildinG BeaconS

## PLAY SMART

You don't need to alter your tactics based on the intelligence of your NPCs. You're encouraged to act intelligently, attacking vulnerable characters and avoiding dangerous situations.

For example, beacons have the ability to actively defend each other using INTERPOSE or other defensive abilities. You can intentionally attack beacons supporting their allies from the back lines, because defender-type beacons will be able to step in and protect them. Unlike other games, you don't need to directly target the defender-type beacons just because they're the 'party tank' . Attack intelligently, and let your players utilize their defensive abilities.

That being said, you don't HAVE to do this. You can intentionally have your NPCs use poor tactics or make bad decisions. For example, you can play an NPC Fury as someone that only attacks the closest enemy. Just know that the game is designed around the idea that you can attack intelligently as a GM and don't need to pull your punches.

But remember: always root for your players to win.

## USE A VARIETY OF NPC ROLES

Each NPC type has a role, much like classes do: defender, striker, controller, and so on.

When designing combat scenes, it's best to use a variety of NPC types. This makes the combat feel more dynamic and gives the PCs more engaging decisions points. For example, if there's a Healer NPC keeping a Protector NPC alive, it will encourage the PCs to find a way to take out the Healer first.

Above all, don't put too many defenders in a combat scene. Defenders generally have high HP and low damage output, so combat scenes filled with too many of them can feel like a slog.

## USE NPCS WITH VARYING INITIATIVES

NPCs have set INITIATIVE scores (p. 260) and act in specific phases instead of operating according to the freeform approach used by PCs. Try to incorporate NPCs with a variety of INITIATIVE scores into each combat scene, keeping them from all clumping together.

For example, the Architect, Gladiator, and Firebug NPC types all have INITIATIVE 5 . If you have them all in a combat scene, that will slow everything down during PHASE . One result is that the PCs won't have much reason to change their plans on the fly, since they know the NPCs will always act during PHASE . Instead, consider using a Protector ( INITIATIVE 1 ), Firebug ( INITIATIVE 5 ), and Titan ( INITIATIVE 7 ). These NPC types have the same roles, but their actions are spread out through the phases.

## LOOT AND REWARDS

Beacons can receive additional rewards outside of their class-based rewards. These rewards might be primarily narrative, like gaining the trust or backing of a powerful organization, while others have effects in combat play, like SUPPLIES , RESIDUUM , and loot .

Loot is the most common type of reward that beacons will acquire during the game, as they'll earn at least one piece of loot after every quest.

## LOOT

Loot includes a range of equipment and techniques that aren't tied to specific classes. It is usually presented to the players via loot crates . A loot crate is a set of three random pieces of loot from which the player can select one to keep. The full list of loot can be found in Appendix B: Loot (p. 356).

Once a beacon has obtained a particular piece of loot, it operates like any other unlockable equipment or technique. They have permanent access to it and can choose to equip it when preparing for quests. Unless it is Unique , they can equip multiple instances of it at a time.

Loot is categorized by rarity. It can be Uncommon , Rare , or Legendary .  The rarer a piece of loot, the more likely it is to have powerful effects. That doesn't mean more common items are weak, however; the power of loot is very dependent on the play style of the beacon that uses it.

Here's an example of a piece of loot:

<!-- image -->

On Crit: You regain 1 MP and your target loses 1 MP .

As you can see, ABSORPTION looks just like any other weapon. The only difference is the rarity tag, which is Uncommon in this case.

## Assigning Loot

After every quest, each player receives a loot crate whether or not the quest was successful.

Each player's loot crate is unique, and whatever they choose from it is tied to their character specifically. By default, players can't trade loot between each other.

## Bonus Loot

Whenever you feel appropriate, you can give out extra loot crates or even give players specific pieces of loot.

In the case of a narratively unique piece of loot, like a TENTACLE ROD crafted from the severed arm of a Kraken

Boss the beacons defeated, you might offer one copy to the group as a whole and let the players decide who gets to keep it. For pieces of loot that are less unique, you can give a copy to each player.

## Loot Crates

Each loot crate has three slots, each containing a random piece of loot. The contents of the slots are generated using either an online generator or by rolling a percentile die (d100).

Slots 1, 2, and 3 each have their own rarity scale, with Slots 2 and 3 being more likely to contain rarer loot.

The chances of a slot holding a weapon, support item, or technique are almost identical. Because it isn't possible to divide 100 by three with dice, however, techniques are very slightly more common.

## Creating Loot Crates

You can use this online GM sheet to easily generate loot crates. To manually create a loot crate, use the following steps for each slot, consulting the table below:

- 1 Determine type: Roll a d100 to determine if the slot contains a weapon, support item, or technique.
- 2 Determine rarity: Roll a d100 to determine the rarity of the slot's contents.
- 3 Determine loot: Choose a piece of loot that matches the type and rarity results for that slot. You can either hand-pick loot or use a random number generator to generate a result using the tables in Appendix B: Loot (Type and Rarity, p. 383).

| LOOT CRATE CONTENTS   | LOOT CRATE CONTENTS   | LOOT CRATE CONTENTS   | LOOT CRATE CONTENTS   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| D100                  | TYPE                  | (ANY                  | SLOT)                 |
| 1-17                  | SKILL                 | SKILL                 | SKILL                 |

| Uncommon              | 1-75                  | 1-30                  | -                     |
| Rare                  | 76-100                | 31-90                 | 1-75                  |
| Legendary             | -                     | 91-100                | 76-100                |

## TRADING LOOT

By default, loot can't be traded between players. This is to prevent players from funneling all of their loot to one person, or feeling entitled to a piece of loot someone else has that would be perfect for their own character. In short, it's a limitation meant to protect everyone's play experience.

One of the most common house rules for BEACON is allowing beacons to trade loot between each other. If you know your group and they work well together, feel free to use that approach.

## Residuum

Residuum can be spent to reroll the random options found in loot crates. Residuum is created with the DISENCHANT LOOT downtime activity and can be spent to apply the following effects. You can choose more than one option to apply to a single roll, and can choose the same option multiple times:

- Ø 1 RESIDUUM : Reroll any one loot crate slot.
- Ø 2 RESIDUUM : Reroll any one loot crate slot and choose a specific type for the slot (weapon, support item, skill, or spell).
- Ø 2 RESIDUUM : Reroll any one loot crate slot. The rerolled slot will be one level rarer than the original result (Uncommon &gt; Rare &gt; Legendary).

Loot is meant to be a fun, random way of getting additional equipment and techniques beyond the ones granted by classes.

In other games that use loot as a reward, it is usually based on the GMs discretion. BEACON puts that part of the game back into the players' hands. They will always get a piece of loot, and will get to make a choice about it, even though it may not be useful to their particular build.

There are downtime activities, like SHOP , that let players trade in loot that they don't plan on using.

## OTHER REWARDS

The players can obtain other rewards that don't have direct rules effects through narrative play. These might include the backing of a powerful organization, an airship, or another base of operations. While these rewards shape the story, they don't have direct effects on combat.

BuildinG BeaconS

## HOMEBREW RULES

'Homebrew' is when you design your own gameplay elements for an existing game - like creating your own classes or equipment for BEACON !

I love homebrew, and a lot of people enjoy adding to existing games. Heck, BEACON originally started as a homebrew version of Lancer!

I encourage you to make homebrew if you're interested. Things that are especially easy to customize or create include NPC types and loot. It can be trickier to create new classes or talents because they have the potential to interact with all other aspects of the game.

Creating variant jobs is a simpler option than creating whole new classes. Variant jobs are variations of the existing jobs that players get through classes. Each class has a job of the same name. For example, the Warlord class has the Warlord job by default; however, if you designed a Valkyrie job, you could make that a variant Warlord job. When one of your players gains rank 1 in the Warlord class, they could choose to gain either the Warlord job or the Valkyrie job (but not both).

There's also room for prestige jobs .  These jobs aren't tied to specific classes, but can instead be unlocked through downtime activities. This is a great way to add homebrew jobs to the game, and you can easily introduce a trainer or downtime activity to provide players with access to it.

## 11: NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS

Characters controlled by the GM are called non-player characters , or NPCs. NPCs can be friends, foes, beasts, or anything else that the GM presents.

In narrative play, NPCs don't roll dice or have attributes. Instead, they react to actions taken by the players.

In combat play, NPCs are characters with their own set of rules that are slightly different from the players. Bosses are a special type of NPC, meant to challenge an entire group of beacons by themselves, and have their own unique rules (see p. 323).

This chapter covers the rules that govern NPCs, as well as the specific types of NPCs that can be used in combat scenes.

## COMBAT PLAY NPCS

BEACON doesn't give unique attributes for every single character and monster the players might face. Instead, each NPC fits into one of several broad frameworks, called NPC types .

NPCs can be further customized with templates. Instead of having character levels like beacons, they have a tier from 1-3.

## ALLIED NPCS

Occasionally, an NPC will fight on the side of the beacons. These allied NPCs are still considered NPCs and controlled by the GM, but are allies of the PCs and enemies of the opposing NPCs.

## NPC TYPE

NPC types are collections of abilities and attributes that represent general themes, similar to beacons' jobs. For example, an NPC with the Firebug type could be a fire-breathing dragon as easily as it could be a magitech pyromancer.

An NPC's type determines the ability scores, attributes, and abilities that the NPC will use. NPCs' ability scores and attributes are static numbers and aren't calculated like they are for beacons, although they can increase at higher tiers.

For example, the Cleaver NPC type has 2 BULK and 16 HP at tier 1. At tier 2, they have 3 BULK and 20 HP , which would be impossible for a beacon.

Like PC classes, NPC types fall into a few basic roles:

- Ø Artillery: Deals damage over long range.
- Ø Controller: Manipulates foes or the battlefield to gain an advantage.
- Ø Defender: Protects their allies or draws attention to themselves.
- Ø Striker: Deals damage over close-to-medium range.
- Ø Support: Assists allies, either by healing, mitigating damage, or enhancing other characters.

The full list of NPC types can be found on p. 387.

## NPC TEMPLATES

Templates are additional sets of features that can be added to NPCs, which can drastically alter how they play. There are two types of templates: thematic and mechanical .

Thematic templates represent sets of abilities associated with specific types of enemies, like Beasts, Oozes, and Undead.

Mechanical templates represent NPCs that are easier or harder than normal, like a group of weak Minions or a Mini-Boss. Mechanical templates impact how many points it costs from the NPC budget to add that NPC to the combat scene.

NPCs can have multiple templates at once, although no more than two is a good guideline.

## NPC TIER

NPCs come in one of three tiers: tier 1 ( T1 ), tier 2 ( T2 ), and tier 3 ( T3 ).

NPCs of higher tiers are stronger and tougher than those of lower tiers. Each tier is meant to provide a challenge to characters of certain levels:

- Ø T1: Level 1-4
- Ø T2: Level 5-8
- Ø T3: Level 9-12

It is possible for the beacons to face NPCs of a higher tier than their current level, but these fights represent harder challenges.

An NPC's tier changes certain values. When an NPC's rules contain three values separated by a slash (e.g., +1/+2/+3 or 5/10/15), this indicates different values used by different tiers. T1 NPCs use the first value, T2 NPCs use the middle value, and T3 NPCs use the last value.

## NPC FEATURES

NPC types and templates provide unique sets of features for NPCs, which are their traits, equipment, and techniques. These features come in three types: base features, extra features, and universal features . Base features and extra features come from an NPCs type and template, whereas universal features are available to all NPCs.

NPCs always have their base features equipped by default. Extra features, on the other hand, are optional abilities. When choosing your NPCs, you can optionally give an NPC 0-2 extra features from their pool of available extra features.

Universal features (p. 304) count as extra features, but are available to every NPC instead of being tied to a specific NPC type or template.

Unlike PCs, NPCs don't have equipment slots or MEMORY .  They just equip whatever abilities are provided by their chosen base and extra features, regardless of their listed equipment size.

Because NPCs don't have GRIT , every ability that involves an attack has its own attack bonus. The description for each of these abilities lists the specific attack bonus to use, including whether there is any or .

For example, a Cleaver NPC attacking with their ENERGY CLEAVER weapon would roll 1d20+2 at tier 1.

<!-- image -->

| Energy Cleaver FIGHT                     | Energy Cleaver FIGHT                     |

## NPC INITIATIVE

NPCs take their turns in a different way than PCs. Instead of acting based on the phase of the standard action they want to perform, each NPC has an INITIATIVE , which ranges from 1-8. This specifies the phase in which they take their turn. During that phase, the NPC can take any action, not only those options available to PCs during that phase.

For example, Elementalist NPCs have INITIATIVE 1 . They take their turn during PHASE BOLSTER , at which time they can take any action. They can use the VOLLEY action to attack with their PRIMAL STAFF , a ranged weapon, during their turn even though it's not PHASE SKIRMISH , because they don't follow the same action rules as the PCs.

Certain templates can give an NPC multiple turns, and therefore multiple INITIATIVES . For example, the Elite template gives an NPC 2 turns each round. It takes their normal INITIATIVE and adds 5 to determine their second INITIATIVE . For example, Vulture NPCs have

INITIATIVE 3 . An Elite Vulture would have two INITIATIVES of 3 and 8 (3 + 5 = 8). Templates that provide additional turns explain when they happen.

Some NPC actions are slightly different from PC actions. The next page explains the differences.

## RECHARGING

Certain NPC abilities have a Recharge X+ tag.

Whenever an NPC uses a Recharge ability, it can't be used again until that ability recharges.

At the start of each of the NPC's turns after using a Recharge ability, the NPC rolls a d6 recharge die . If the result equals or exceeds the Recharge value (X) of any Recharge abilities they have, those abilities recharge.

For example, a Firebug uses Siegebreaker ,  a Recharge 5+ ability. At the start of the Firebug's next turn, they roll a d6 and get a 6. Because this is greater than 5, the ability recharges, and the Firebug can use it again this turn.

NPCs only make one recharge roll each turn, but that roll can recharge multiple abilities at once.

## NPC SPECIAL RULES

There are some additional ways that NPCs differ from PCs:

- Ø NPCs start with WOUND CAP 1 and are defeated when they take a Wound. If an NPC has WOUND CAP 2+ , they follow the normal Wound rules for PCs.
- Ø NPCs start with OVERSTRESS CAP 1 but they don't make an overstress roll when they exceed their STRESS CAP . Instead, while exceeding their STRESS CAP , they are VULNERABLE . If an NPC has OVERSTRESS CAP 2+ , they follow the normal Overstress rules for PCs.
- Ø If an NPC doesn't have a STRESS CAP , they take Stress as Force damage.
- Ø NPCs can't use the Reroll Table .
- Ø NPCs can't SURGE .

## DESIGNING NPCS

When designing an NPC, do the following:

- 1 Pick an NPC type.
- 2 Choose templates, if any.
- 3 Choose 0-2 extra features. Extra features can be chosen from the NPC's type, the list of universal NPC features (p. 304), and any templates.
- 4 Choose a tier.

NPCs can look or act like anything. A Fortress NPC could be a literal walking tower, or even a giant spider.

## TINKERING WITH NPCS

The abilities listed with each NPC type are examples meant to be evocative. Changing a weapon from one weapon type to another (e.g., making a blade a longarm) doesn't really affect anything.

In general, you can change whether NPC features are weapons, support items, skills, or spells without

## NPC ACTIONS

During their turns, NPCs can perform a standard action , a standard movement , and a minor action .

## Phase Bolster

DEFEND: Attacks against this NPC receive +1 until the start of their next turn.

REFRESH: This NPC regains all MP then can choose one of the following:

- Ø Reload all Reloading weapons and abilities.
- Ø Clear a condition.

## Phase Channel

CHANNEL: As normal, but if the NPC takes this action during PHASE RELEASE (only possible for NPCs with multiple turns), they can't RELEASE it until the next round.

## Phase Skirmish

VOLLEY: As normal, but improvised spell attacks have a +1/+2/+3 attack bonus.

MARK:

As normal.

SEARCH:

## Phase Reposition

RUSH: As normal.

HIDE:

altering gameplay too much. For example, changing the Gunner's REPEATER from a weapon to a spell isn't a big change.

If you want to make an NPC more challenging, you can give them additional extra features beyond the normal 0-2.

NPCs have access to some of the same actions as PCs, but with some changes. Their actions are outlined below.

## Phase Brawl

FIGHT: As normal, but improvised weapon attacks have a +1/+2/+3 attack bonus.

SHOVE: As normal, but with a +1/+2/+3 attack bonus.

GRAPPLE: As normal, but with a +1/+2/+3 attack bonus.

## Phase Release

RELEASE:

As normal.

## Phase Full Attack

FULL ATTACK: As normal, but NPCs need a special feature to be able to FULL ATTACK . If an NPC has multiple turns, they can FULL ATTACK 1/turn.

## Special Actions

READY: As normal.

## Reactions

OPPORTUNITY ATTACK:

A rchitects are Trap -focused NPCs, placing their Traps in chokepoints and forcing their enemies to either avoid areas or disable them to proceed. There is no limit to the number of Traps an Architect can place, and if not dealt with, they can quickly fortify a position. The Architect and their allies don't trigger these Traps , and the Architect has a number of ways to knock enemies right into them.

Beware of high-mobility beacons who can easily move around isolated Traps , or artillery beacons that can take out Architects before they have a chance to litter the battlefield with Traps .

C hargers are fast-moving attackers that utilize hit-and-run tactics. They should always be moving, and they gain benefits when using RUSH .  Their main weapons push foes on hits, which lets them pivot to new targets without provoking opportunity attacks. Preventing a Charger from moving shuts down many of their abilities and leaves them vulnerable.

C leavers are physical brutes with dangerous attacks. They want to position themselves near as many foes as possible and attack as often as they can to make the most use of their WIDE ARC trait. It is difficult to defend against Cleavers, as they increase FOCUS costs or even outright destroy FOCUS . Fortunately for their enemies, Cleavers have low A-DEF and STRESS CAP scores, and lack any abilities that work at range aside from HOOK .

W hether they be demonologists, necromancers, or beastmasters, all conjurers are expert summoners. They specialize in calling on conscripts, versatile Summons that can be any sort of creature. Conjurers stay in the back and place their conscripts in front of them, letting their Summons whittle down enemies while the Conjurer channels powerful spells.

E lementalists protect their allies with magic, supporting them with arcane shields and preventing enemy access to certain areas. These units work from the back lines, lacking their own direct defenses, and are easily overwhelmed. Elementalists are also heavily dependent on MP , and negating their ability to regain it, or causing them to burn through it too quickly can cause them to waste actions.

E xpendables are cannon fodder, a step above Minions. Because they are deployed in pairs (see QUANTITY OVER QUALITY ), they try to use their superior numbers to defeat their foes. Expendables aren't expected to survive encounters, and try to either deal as much damage as they can or hinder their foes so their allies can take them out.

On Hit: If the target is the same SIZE as the Expendable or smaller, they are pulled adjacent to and GRAPPLED by the Expendable. If the target is larger, the Expendable is pulled adjacent to them and they are then GRAPPLED by the Expendable.

## Scramble

TRAIT

## EXPENDABLES AND TEMPLATES

For the rest of the turn after using RUSH ,  the Expendable moves normally in difficult terrain and climbing costs half as much movement as normal.

Expendables are particularly dangerous when paired with the Minion template. They are designed to be easily defeated and overwhelming in numbers. The Minion template intensifies both of these characteristics, with little additional downsides. Be careful if you decide to use this combination.

W hile usually associated with fire, Firebugs can be portrayed as utilizing any type of energy. Focused on closerange AOE attacks, Firebugs wield devastating effects that deal damage over time - damage that can quickly grow out of control. Beacons that spread out weaken the effectiveness of Firebugs, so look for opportunities to keep them clustered together.

F ortresses are slow, bulky defenders that use their size to protect their allies. They provide a space in which their allies receive defensive bonuses. As such, Fortresses want to keep as many allies as possible within their spaces and stay the focus of enemy attacks. Allies within the Fortress have no protection from AOEs and are still susceptible to forced movement taking them outside the Fortress. Although they have a lot of HP , Fortresses are VULNERABLE to Piercing damage and easily become overstressed.

G ladiators are survivors of countless battles through which they've learned tricks and techniques that can take enemies by surprise. Their equipment influences their strategy, but the Gladiator's basic role is to stay near allies and protect them with their BOUNCE SHIELD , and move or immobilize enemies to further protect their backline. Gladiators are unable to protect their allies from auto-hit or auto-damaging abilities.

G unners are long-distance fighters whose damage is dependent on their MP . As artillery units, they want to position themselves far away from any danger, leveraging their long range to keep themselves safe and stationary. Gunners can regain MP while stationary, which allows them to attack for longer before needing to recover MP . They are heavily customizable thanks to their SPECIAL BULLETS , which have a variety of effects. Effects that disarm the gunner reduce their maximum MP , too, which can weaken them during long fights.

## Base Features

## Backup Weapons

## Special Bullets

## TRAIT

1/turn before attacking, the Gunner can apply one of their equipped special bullets to one of their REPEATER attacks. Each type of special bullet must be taken as a separate extra feature and counts as a separate support item.

H ealers are vulnerable support units that can keep their allies alive on the battlefield. The longer a Healer remains on the field, the more HP they can restore to their allies. To make the most of Healers, they need to be properly defended - they have little in the way of physical defenses, although their A-DEF is higher than average. Healers with the RESURRECT spell can dramatically change the momentum of a fight, especially when an Elite or Mini-Boss enemy might be brought back to the fight.

M indreavers infiltrate the minds of their foes, altering their perceptions and placing stress on their psyches. Fighting against a Mindreaver means making difficult decisions and choosing the least harmful option in the moment. Mindreavers inflict lots of Stress and can receive a lot of Stress in return, but are fragile at close range.

M irages are battlefield illusionists, experts in altering the perceptions of their enemies. Invisibility and misdirection are their defensive tools, allowing them to befuddle foes by manipulating positioning. Mirages are hard to hit, and can REDIRECT the rare successful hit against them. Abilities that deal automatic damage and Discord are effective against these lowHP enemies.

S harpshooters are dangerous marksmen, able to eliminate enemies with great precision from extreme distances. They can take their time to line up a shot, delivering massive damage if not contested.

S pecters are ghostly controllers with the ability to move through terrain. Fighting a Specter is a tiring exercise, as they can easily vanish or move across a map. These apparitions go wherever they want, staying close to enemies they think can't hit them or staying at range and hampering movement. Reduce their MP to stop them from disappearing or using REFORM , or hit them with damage that isn't affected by their invisibility.

## Base Features

## MINOR ACTION

## Ethereal Shift SPELL  MANA 1

The Specter becomes INVISIBLE until the start of their next turn.

## Frighten SKILL

<!-- image -->

A character within RANGE must make a MIND save. Failure: They take 3/4/5 STRESS and are unable to voluntarily move closer to the Specter until the end of their next turn.

Spellshields are trained to counter and weaken enemy spellcasters while sheltering their own allies with magical shields.

T itans are massive, frightening units. They move slowly towards enemies, delivering devastating attacks with their GIGA HAMMER when close enough. They are geared toward keeping enemies close and punishing them for that proximity. Titans are considered controllers because the PCs need to keep them at range or hinder them, otherwise the Titan will cause significant damage.

## TITAN TEMPLATES

Titans should not be given the Mini-Boss template. The best way for beacons to handle a titan is to take them out before they can get close. The Mini-Boss template makes that very unlikely to happen, which can result in an unfun situation to deal with.

W armages are area-based spellcasters that rain fire and destruction from afar. Their channeled abilities can quickly destroy groups of enemies, and their BATTLEMAGE trait allows them to maintain their concentration in the face of enemy attacks at the cost of MP . They have little defense against physical attacks, so try to close the distance quickly and spread out.

## 13: TEMPLATES

Templates are sets of features that can be applied to NPCs. NPCs can have multiple templates, although some templates specify that they can't be combined with others.

## Respawn, Minion

TRAIT

This trait requires the NPC to have the Minion template, and replaces the One Hit trait.

The Undead has 1 HP and 1 STRESS CAP , and is defeated whenever they take any damage or Stress. When defeated, unless the damage or Stress was Astral or from a critical hit , they turn into a SIZE 1/2 object in one of their spaces ( HP 1 , DODGE 8 ).

When the Undead enters a combat scene, mark a free space in the scene as their Respawn Point . Whenever they take a Wound or Overstress, they don't make a wound or overstress roll, and instead teleport to their Respawn Point.

The Undead is still defeated when they reach their WOUND CAP or OVERSTRESS CAP .

TRAIT

Skeletal: The Undead has resistance to Physical from non-club weapons ,  but is VULNERABLE to damage from club weapons .

<!-- image -->

The toughest enemies in the game are Bosses . Unlike Mini-Bosses, each Boss is designed to be an entire combat scene in its own right - a boss battle . When your players face a Boss, they face that specific Boss and their Guardians - no other NPCs are added to the scene.

Bosses make for perfect capstone fights in campaigns or quests. Because of their unique rules, though, they should be used sparingly. Not every quest needs to end in a boss battle. Save them for important moments.

Boss battles don't use battle plans. The goal in these fights is to defeat the Boss. Additionally, Bosses don't use NPC types or templates. They are in a category all of their own, although they do have tiers of power ( T1-3 , like other NPCs).

During a boss battle, the Boss passes through multiple stages. This can represent physical transformations or just changes in tactics.

Additionally, each Boss is accompanied by a number of Guardians , which are NPC units built around the Boss's unique features.

This section introduces three specific Bosses: the Great Wyrm , the Kraken , and the Lich .

## BOSS SPECIAL RULES

Bosses operate differently from other NPC units. This reflects the fact that they are standalone threats - fearsome challenges for any foe.

## Stages

Each boss battle has three stages, representing changes in the Boss's abilities and fighting style. During each stage, the Boss is essentially a new character with different ability scores, attributes, and abilities, though they always have WOUND CAP and OVERSTRESS CAP 1 .

When the Boss takes a Wound, they undergo a transformation and the next stage begins.

## WOUNDS AND OVERSTRESS

Like other NPCs with OVERSTRESS CAP 1 , Bosses are VULNERABLE while exceeding their STRESS CAP .

## Turns

Bosses take a number of turns each round equal to the number of PCs in the combat scene. This number doesn't decrease when PCs are defeated. Bosses' turns alternate with PC turns just like normal NPC turns do.

Despite having extra turns, Bosses can only take one turn during each phase, except for PHASE DELAY , during which they can take multiple turns. Bosses decide which phases they take their turns in each round.

## Actions

During each of a Boss's turns, they can perform a standard action , a standard movement , and a minor action .  Their standard action must be one available in the current phase.

Bosses have access to the same standard actions as other NPCs, but with the following changes.

## Phase Full Attack

Full Attack: The Boss can FULL ATTACK .

## Phase Delay

Delay: The Boss can only DELAY actions they haven't used this round. For example, if the boss has used VOLLEY , they can't VOLLEY again in PHASE DELAY .

## Reactions

Opportunity Attack: The boss can OPPORTUNITY ATTACK any number of times each round.

Bosses can't SURGE or use the Reroll Table unless otherwise indicated.

## Events

Bosses are powerful enemies that shape and alter the environment around them. These effects are called events , and each stage of a boss battle has events associated with it.

Events and their effects just happen. The Boss and their Guardians don't activate them, and aren't considered to be using them as they might an ability.

Events are tied to specific stages. When a boss transforms and the boss battle moves to a new stage, the old event ends and the new one begins.

## Abilities

Bosses' abilities change from stage to stage. Each stage of the boss battle provides the Boss with a wide array of abilities. They have every ability from their current stage equipped.

The equipment carried by Bosses don't always list a size or type. These abilities are not considered to have any size or type.

Some abilities mention a phase and its number followed by a plus sign (e.g., ' Phase + '). These abilities can be used with a standard action during any phase from the listed one onward. For example, an ability with ' Phase + ' can be used as a standard action in PHASE , , , and so on all the way up to PHASE .

## Transformation

When a Boss takes a Wound, they begin to transform. While transforming, Bosses still count as obstructions and are immune to all damage , Stress , and other effects until they enter their next stage. This does not affect Guardians.

Although the Boss is considered to have taken a Wound, they don't make a wound roll and are not defeated.

At the start of the next round, the next stage begins. The Boss clears all Stress , conditions, statuses, and effects, and takes on the listed ability scores, attributes, and abilities. Any events relevant to the new stage then take effect.

Although the Boss is considered the same character throughout all stages, no damage is carried over.

## Complexity

The SEARCH action doesn't work the same way against Bosses and their Guardians as it does against normal NPC units. Instead, each use of the action reveals one of the following:

- Ø The target's current HP , MP , and STRESS .
- Ø The target's traits.
- Ø If the target is the Boss, any abilities they can take on a specific phase (excluding PHASE DELAY ), or any reactions or minor actions they have.
- Ø If the target is a Guardian, their base features.

## Deployment

Bosses and their Guardians always deploy first. The Boss can deploy anywhere on the map (usually in the middle), and the rules for each Boss explain when and where their Guardians are deployed.

## Guardians

Guardians are special NPCs that accompany Bosses. Each stage of a boss battle introduces a certain number of new Guardians. These foes persist between stages, and have the potential to overwhelm the beacons if they aren't dealt with quickly.

Each Boss's Guardians operate uniquely. Some take their own turns, while others act during their Boss's turns.

When a new stage begins, any existing Guardians gain the Guardian profile for the new stage.

## G R E AT   W Y R M

Dragons are incredibly long-lived creatures that grow throughout their lives. The largest and most powerful of these dragons, called Great Wyrms, are terrifying creatures imbued with explosive elemental power.

The Great Wyrm presented here is associated with fire, but you can easily change it to be associated with a different element.

Because the Great Wyrm and its Guardians can fly, the scene should have three or so harpoon terrain features (see below) that the PCs can use to deal ranged damage and bring their enemies to the ground. You can flavor them as magical stones, prepared missiles, or whatever fits for your Reflection.

## HARPOON

PCs standing in a harpoon's space can use their standard action during any phase to make a ranged weapon attack against a target within RANGE 15 .

On Hit: The target takes 1D6+1 PIERCING PHYSICAL , loses FLYING , and cannot resume FLYING until this phase in the next round.

Harpoons must be reloaded after each use. They can be reloaded with a standard action during any phase, or are automatically reloaded if a PC in its space reloads a weapon.

## Tactics

The Great Wyrm and its Guardians prefer when enemies bunch up, which makes it easier to hit them with AOE attacks and abilities. They are at their strongest when they can stack Discord on enemies and move around to catch as many enemies in AOEs as possible.

In Stage 1, the Great Wyrm is most mobile. In Stage 2, it looks for opportunities to knock enemies into Traps . In Stage 3, it becomes enraged and acts less intelligently than before.

## Scene

Don't set up a small or tight battlefield, as one of the PCs' primary defensive strategies will be to spread out.

Fill the map with rocks and rubble for cover and difficult terrain, and place pools of fire or lava as dangerous terrain. You can also change the environment as the scene progresses through each stage, adding more lava and cracks in the ground in the later stages.

REACH 2 8/10/12 PHYSICAL

On Hit: The target is pulled adjacent to and automatically GRAPPLED by the Great Wyrm.

## Gulp SKILL  FULL ATTACK

If the Great Wyrm isn't GRAPPLED , it can use BITE instead of this ability. If it does have a character GRAPPLED , that character must make a contested BULK check as if breaking out of GRAPPLED. Failure: They take 3/4/5 STRESS and are swallowed . They are moved into the Great Wyrm' space and no longer GRAPPLED . The swallowed character is permanently DAZED and IMMOBILIZED and can't target or be targeted by anything outside the Great Wyrm's space. They move when the Great Wyrm moves. Additionally, they take an additional +1 Discord from INESCAPABLE HEAT . Swallowed characters can break free by making a BULK save as a minor action .

The Great Wyrm can only swallow characters if there is sufficient room in its space.

Krakens are powerful underwater creatures that prey on ships with their powerful tentacles and storm magic. Fights against the Kraken must take place aboard a ship (see below).

## KRAKEN

## THE SHIP

The ship counts as an object that can't be moved. Only the Kraken and its Guardians can damage the ship, but only using abilities that specifically mention this. Instead of having HP , damage to the ship is represented by the destruction of 1-space segments. Destroyed segments of ship are replaced by water.

Beacons can repair destroyed ship segments with standard actions during any phase. Each time a beacon performs repairs, they can restore 1d3 spaces within SCOPE , changing them back from water spaces to ship spaces. They can take 1 STRESS to reroll the 1d3.

## Tactics

The full Kraken only appears during the final stage of this boss battle. In Stage 1, the PCs fight its tentacles, which are its Guardians. The Guardians focus on damaging the ship on which the beacons fight. In Stage 2 the PCs must contend with dangerous events. In Stage 3, the Kraken appears and focuses on attacking as many enemies as possible.

## Scene

The combat scene takes place on a 12 x 12 map, with the beacons deploying on a 6 x 6 ship in the middle of the map. The rest of the map is water, which is considered difficult terrain . Characters with Aquatic Adaptations can move normally in these spaces, but are still imperiled by the Kraken's SNAPPING JAWS trait.

## S TA G E   1:   T H E   A R M S

Towering tentacles rise out of the water and begin smashing into the nearby ship.

## Guardians

There are two types of Guardians: Slammers and Smashers . Slammers have INITIATIVE 2 , Smashers have INITIATIVE 5 . Deploy one Slammer and one Smasher per PC in free water spaces adjacent to the ship.

Each Guardian takes up 1 space - like a SIZE 1 character - but they still count as SIZE 3 .

## GUARDIAN BASE FEATURES

## Sea Monster

TRAIT

The Kraken and its Guardians move normally in water spaces, but treat non-water spaces as difficult terrain . They generally avoid entering ship spaces.

## Slam (Slammer Only) SKILL

CHANNEL

LINE 3

On Channel: The AOE is a zone that lasts while it is channeling. If the Slammer moves or is moved, the area moves with them, mirroring its movement.

On Release: Any ship spaces in the zone are destroyed and characters in the zone take 8/10/12 PHYSICAL .

## Smash (Smasher Only) FIGHT  +1/2/3 VS DODGE MELEE WEAPON REACH 1 6/8/10 PHYSICAL

If there are any enemies adjacent to the Smasher and targetable, attacks with this weapon must target them. Otherwise, it automatically destroys an adjacent ship space.

## Events

## SNAPPING JAWS

If a character other than the Kraken or one of its Guardians ends their turn in a water space, they must make an AGILITY check or take 3 STRESS .

## Special Rules

The Kraken does not actually appear in this stage. Instead, the PCs fight its tentacles, represented by Guardians.

In this stage, the Guardians are treated like normal NPCs. They take their own turns and have their own Initiatives; however, they can only use the abilities listed in their base features, taking no other actions.

The Kraken begins its transformation when either of the following takes place:

- Ø Half of the originally deployed Guardians have been defeated.
- Ø Half of the total ship spaces are destroyed.

Once the transformation is initiated, Stage 2 begins in the following round.

Keep track of the number of Guardians remaining when Stage 2 begins, as it is relevant in Stage 3.

## S TA G E   2 :   T H E   S T O R M

The tentacles suddenly retreat underwater, earning the beacons a brief respite. But within moments, they feel their hair beginning to stand on end. Electric storms begin to coalesce, crackling with static energy, while the Kraken sends a tidal wave to sweep the beacons away.

## Events

## BUILDING STORM

Randomly place one 1-space Building Storm Marker per PC. At the end of Round 2, these storms begin discharging their energy. All characters take 5 ASTRAL per building storm.

Characters can dispel a storm by succeeding on a MAGIC check as a standard action during any phase. Attempting this causes the character to take 5 ASTRAL .

## TIDAL WAVE

A tidal wave forms along one of the edges of the map. It is a straight line as long as that side of the map and 1 space wide.

Each round, the tidal wave moves 3 spaces toward the other end of the map twice: once at the end of PHASE and once at the end of PHASE . Any characters it moves through must destroy a piece of equipment or technique and are knocked PRONE .

Each space of the tidal wave has 10 HP , and is destroyed when it reaches 0 HP .  These spaces are immune to all statuses, conditions, and effects except for damage. Attacks auto-hit them, and they automatically fail any checks or saves.

When the tidal wave reaches the other side of the map, it disappears.

## SNAPPING JAWS

If a character other than the Kraken or one of its Guardians ends their turn in a water space, they must make an AGILITY check. Failure: They take 3 STRESS .

## Special Rules

At the beginning of this stage, note how many Guardians remain and remove them from the scene - there is no Kraken or Guardians until Stage 3.

This stage lasts for two rounds, after which Stage 3 begins.

## CHALLENGE MODE

To make the fight more difficult, you can create a new tidal wave at any side of the map once the old one disappears. This continues until the end of the scene.

## S TA G E   3 :   T H E   D E E P   O N E

The full scale of this monster is finally revealed as the Kraken emerges! Its tentacles flail in anger as it attempts to grab and crush the puny beacons arrayed before it.

## Special Rules

The Kraken itself enters play during this stage, deploying in free water spaces anywhere in the scene.

## Guardians

At the beginning of this scene, deploy one new Guardian per PC, plus one new Guardian for every Guardian that remained undefeated at the end of Stage 1. All Guardians are deployed in free water spaces adjacent to the ship.

Guardians can only use Snatch , taking no other actions except for those granted by the Kraken's Grand Slam ability. They automatically have this action ready to perform as an OPPORTUNITY ATTACK. They can also perform it if one of the Kraken's actions allow them to do so.

During the Kraken's turns, its Guardians can move up to their SPEED .

## Tactics

Liches and their Guardians are fragile and dependent on mana. They want to remain as far away from enemies as possible. Despite this, once the Lich's Living Soul leaves their body in Stage 2, they immediately play more aggressively, since they will remain invulnerable until the end of Stage 3.

## Scene

This boss battle benefits from a larger map. The Lich's long SCOPE and the Guardians' ranged abilities mean they want to keep their distance. Because the Lich can teleport , consider creating locations on the battle map that are hard to access without teleportation , flight , or climbing . Don't make them completely inaccessible, but give the Lich plenty of opportunities to evade danger so the PCs can focus on taking out Guardians.

Liches are the ultimate spellcasters, immortal beings that use magic to fuel their undying existence. Lichdom requires extensive knowledge of necromancy, but their long lives and raw magical power allow them to master other forms of magic as well.

<!-- image -->

Be sure to include cover and terrain that blocks line of sight so the PCs can avoid or mitigate the significant number of ranged attacks they are likely to face in this boss battle. You may also want to include beneficial terrain features for the PCs, either as a way to entice them to good positions or to force them to choose between a good position or a bad one with a beneficial terrain effect.

The Lich and certain PCs will want to be in Mana Nexuses as much as possible, so think ahead where you'd like to place them. You can change their positions in each stage, but having the position of at least the Stage 1 nexuses planned will save you time.

## S TA G E   1:   T H E   W I Z A R D   S U P R E M E

The Lich uses illusions to mask their true appearance, presenting themselves as a grand wizard with a retinue of apprentices. The illusion can't fully compensate for the jerking movements of their undead attendants, or the uneasy feeling caused by their presence.

## A: SHOPS AND SUPPLIES

Shops are places where beacons can exchange GOLD for SUPPLIES (p. 18). SUPPLIES are minor items beacons can bring on quests that don't cost equipment slots or MEMORY to equip. They must be equipped at the beginning of each quest, at the same time as other equipment and techniques. Beacons can equip up to three SUPPLIES per quest (no duplicates), and all equipped SUPPLIES are destroyed at the end of the quest.

Shops provide a way to thematically group SUPPLIES together. For example, the Alchemy Shop sells SUPPLIES that are narratively potions and elixirs, while the Tavern sells food and drink SUPPLIES . Beacons can buy or acquire SUPPLIES with the Go Shopping or Pursue a Profession downtime activities (p. 29, p. 31), but the GM can also give them out as rewards (p. 20).

When beacons Go Shopping or otherwise have an opportunity to select SUPPLIES from a shop, not every option is always in stock. Instead, the GM either randomly or manually decides which SUPPLIES are currently available. It is recommended that no more than five different SUPPLIES are available in each shop at a time.

Similarly, not every shop will be available during every downtime. For example, a city that hates magitech may not always have an Engineer available; however, the General Store should always be available.

Loot is bonus equipment and techniques that beacons earn as quest rewards. Loot is usually presented to the players in loot crates (p. 257), each of which is three pieces of loot from which the player can select one to keep.

The GM can either randomly or manually pick loot to give to PCs. The tables later in this appendix arrange loot by type (weapon, support item, technique) and rarity (Uncommon, Rare, Legendary) to make it easier to randomly generate loot. In addition, a loot crate randomizer can be found here .

This section lists all loot in alphabetical order.

## GENERAL TERMINOLOGY

Ancestry: Ancestry describes a beacon's heritage or species. It determines their SIZE and gives access to a list of ancestry traits . Whenever a beacon goes on a quest, they can choose to equip one of their ancestry traits.

Boss: The toughest enemies in the game are Bosses. Bosses have their own unique rules for combat.

Battle Plan: Battle plans provide the framework for combat scenes, determining the win conditions for the PCs, the NPC budget, and any special rules.

Class: Classes represent specialized approaches to combat. Classes unlock equipment and abilities that beacons can equip for quests. Each class has three ranks, with each rank unlocking additional equipment and abilities.

Hub: A base of operations for beacons.

Job: Jobs provide the starting values for a beacon's attributes and their equipment slots. A class's job is unlocked upon reaching rank 1 in that class.

Level/Character Level: Each beacon has a character level , which represents their overall growth and strength. Whenever you finish a quest, whether you were successful or not, your beacon gains another character level. The maximum character level for beacons is 12.

Loot: Loot includes a range of equipment and techniques that aren't tied to specific classes. It is usually presented to the players via loot crates . Loot is categorized by rarity. It can be Uncommon , Rare , or Legendary .

Loot Crate: A loot crate is a set of three random pieces of loot from which the player can select one to keep.

Non-Player Character (NPC): Characters controlled by the GM are called non-player characters , or NPCs. NPCs can be friends, foes, beasts, or anything else that the GM presents.

NPC Template: T emplates are additional sets of features that can be added to NPCs, which can drastically alter how they play. There are two types of templates: thematic and mechanical .

NPC Tier: NPCs come in one of three tiers: tier 1 ( T1 ), tier 2 ( T2 ), and tier 3 ( T3 ). NPCs of higher tiers are stronger and tougher than those of lower tiers.

NPC Type: NPC types are collections of abilities and attributes that represent general themes, similar to player character jobs.

Quest: Quests are adventures that beacons go on, each comprising a combination of narrative and combat play.

Reflection: The many settings of BEACON . Each setting is called a Reflection.

Resting: Resting allows PCs to heal, recover resources, and repair equipment. There are two types of rests: Short Rests and Long Rests . Short Rests are quick breaks that allow beacons to patch themselves up after a fight, while Long Rests are longer and more restorative.

Title: All beacons have a title, which can be used during narrative play to gain a +2 bonus to a skill check.

## NARRATIVE TERMINOLOGY

Adversity Challenge: A type of skill challenge representing the obstacles the beacons encounter between combat scenes, like moving through dangerous rooms in a dungeon or sneaking past patrolling guards to ambush a target.

Background Skills: Words or brief phrases that represent a beacon's history and training. Background skills have three ranks. Skill checks use background skills, and grant +1 on the roll for reach rank in the skill.

Downtime Activity: When beacons have free time, they can perform downtime activities.

Narrative Action: Narrative actions are a type of skill check with specific outcomes.

Skill Challenge: Skill challenges are series of rapid skill checks. Skill challenges can be split into two categories: story challenges and adversity challenges .

Skill Check: Skills checks are used to determine success during narrative play.

Story Challenge: A type of skill challenge. Story challenges are used when an obstacle or scene is too complex to be resolved with a single skill check.

## COMBAT TERMINOLOGY

Ability: All techniques, traits, and equipment. Basically, if something does something in combat, it's an ability.

Ability Check/Save: A roll made to overcome an obstacle or resist an effect. Effects that prompt ability checks or saves indicate which ability score BULK , AGILITY , MIND , or MAGIC is used for the roll. Background skills, GRIT , and titles don't apply. To succeed on an ability check , you need a result of 10+. To succeed on a save , your result must equal or exceed the SAVE TARGET of the initiator, or 10 if not otherwise specified.

Ability Scores: The four ability scores BULK, AGILITY, MIND, MAGIC - affect a character's attributes and actions in combat play.

Ally: A character friendly to you or on the same side. You don't count as your own ally.

Area of Effect (AOE): Abilities and effects with an AOE affect multiple targets or spaces. Blast , Burst , Close Blast , and Line are types of AOEs.

Attack: Attempts by characters to hit and harm something with weapons, magic, or other means. To hit your target, your result must equal or exceed their defense (either DODGE or A-DEF , depending on the type of attack). Attacks can be either melee attacks or ranged attacks , and can be further categorized as weapon, spell, support, or skill attacks.

Attribute: Beacons have several attributes that are used in combat play, such as DODGE and SIZE .  These scores are determined by a character's level, job, ancestry, talents, ability scores, equipment, and techniques.

Bonus Damage: Additional damage added onto an existing source of damage. Effects with more than one target only deal half their bonus damage to each target. Only successful attacks or abilities that deal damage can deal bonus damage.

Character: PCs, Summons , and NPCs are all considered characters. As a general rule, characters are entities capable of taking some sort of actions, either personally or at the command of other characters.

Climbing: A special form of movement that allows characters to move atop objects such as terrain. Climbing has a movement cost equal to the object's SIZE + 1 . Characters standing atop objects are considered to have their SIZE increased by the SIZE of whatever they are standing on for the purposes of determining line of sight and cover (p. 49).

Concentration Save: While channeling, if you take any damage (after ARMOR ) or Stress not caused by yourself, you must pass a BULK save against the initiator's SAVE TARGET . On a failure, you stop channeling and the action is lost.

Cover: Objects on the battlefield can provide cover. Cover imposes on attacks and can block line of sight, depending on whether it is hard cover or soft cover . Soft cover grants +1 to attacks, but doesn't block line of sight. Hard cover grants +2 to attacks and can block line of sight.

Critical Hit: On a result of 20+, an attack roll is a crit . Roll all damage dice twice and take the highest result.

Damage: Harm done to another character. Damage is subtracted from HP , and comes in different types (Physical, Force, Astral, Lunar, Discord).

Dangerous Terrain: Terrain that can cause damage. 1/round when you enter dangerous terrain or end your turn in it, you must make an ability check of the GM's choice. Failure: Y ou take 5 damage of any type or Stress based on the type of terrain.

Defeat: When a beacon is defeated, all effects on them and that originated from them are removed, including Summons . Damage, conditions, statuses, and created objects and terrain remain, including Traps .

Difficult Terrain: Terrain that slows movement. It has +1 movement cost.

Discord X: Discord is a special effect that applies ongoing damage. A character or object that takes Discord immediately takes Piercing discord damage equal to the amount of Discord gained. The Discord they took is then added to any Discord they already have. At the end of each turn while they have Discord, the character or object makes a MAGIC check. On a successful save, all Discord is cleared from them. On a failure, they take Piercing discord damage equal to their current Discord. For more information on Discord, see p. 58.

Enemy: A character that is hostile to you or on the other side.

Environmental Factors: Effects that alter combat scenes, individual spaces, or even objects. Some apply to the entire combat scene, while others affect characters in smaller areas.

Equipment: Weapons and support items are equipment.

Flight: Characters with flight can activate or deactivate the FLYING status 1/turn as a free action.

Forced Movement: Any involuntary movement that pushes , pulls , or slides a character. Forced movements do not provoke reactions and ignore ENGAGEMENT .  Y ou can't be forcibly moved into a space you can't enter.

Free Action: Free actions can only be taken during your turn, but you can perform any number of free actions during that turn.

Grit: An attribute representing the combat experience that beacons gain when they increase their character level. Starting at character level 2 and then at every second level after that (i.e., levels 4, 6, 8, etc.), beacons gain +1 GRIT . GRIT is a passive bonus that applies to several other attributes.

Immunity: When a character is immune to something, they are unaffected by that type of effect.

Initiative: NPCs take their turns in a different way than PCs. Instead of acting based on the phase of the standard action they want to perform, each NPC has an INITIATIVE , which ranges from 1-8. This specifies the phase in which they take their turn. During that phase, the NPC can take any action, not only those options available to PCs during that phase.

Limit Break: Every job has a limit break, which is a power, scene-changing ability unique to that job. Beacons can only perform one limit break per quest.

Line of Sight: All abilities require a clear path to their target, known as line of sight.

Linked Weapons: Two weapons can be linked together to form a linked pair .  When you attack with a linked weapon, you can also attack with the weapon it's linked to as a part of the same action. This is called a linked attack, and each linked pair can only make 1 linked attack per turn (p. 16).

Minor Action: Y ou can perform one minor action during your turn. Minor actions can be used during any phase.

Movement/Standard Movement: You can use your standard movement to move a number of spaces equal to your SPEED .

Object : Anything that isn't a character (or part of one). The terrain, parts of the environment, and deployed items (like Traps ) are all objects.

Obstruction: If a character or object is the same SIZE as you or larger, you can't move through their spaces. Allied characters and enemy characters smaller than you don't count as obstructions and you can move through their spaces, but you can't end a movement sharing spaces with another character.

Phase: The various stages of the round during which characters can act. The phase in which a character takes a turn is usually decided by the action they want to perform, as each action can only be performed in a specific phase.

Range/Reach: The maximum number of spaces within which a given ability can be used. Range and Reach work in the same way, but some effects trigger based on one or the other, not both.

Reaction: Special actions performed in response to specific triggers, even on other character's turns. You can perform one reaction per turn, but there is no limit on how many times a specific reaction can be used unless one is specified.

Reroll Table: When making an attack, ability check, or save in combat , you can reroll the dice by using the Reroll Table . To use the table, you choose one of the listed options and reroll all dice for one roll (including or ). Each option from the table can only be chosen once per round (p. 52).

Resistance: Reduces damage by half.

Round: Each combat scene is made up of a number of rounds , each of which is split up into eight distinct phases . At the end of the eighth phase, the round ends and another round begins.

Shift: A special movement that doesn't provoke reactions and ignores ENGAGEMENT . You can't shift if you are SLOWED or IMMOBILIZED .

Scene: An entire combat, from beginning to end. Once the fighting is over, the scene ends.

Squeezing: A special form of movement that allows characters to fit into spaces one SIZE smaller than them, but increases the cost of all movements by +1 while doing so (p. 55).

Standard Action: Characters can take one standard action per turn. Beacons can only use standard actions from the current phase.

Stress: A special type of harm that doesn't count as damage and doesn't affect the recipient's HP . Stress accumulates up to a character's STRESS CAP .

Surging: Beacons can surge 1/round to take a second turn at the cost of taking Stress (p. 42).

Talent: Sets of abilities that don't need to be equipped. Once your beacon has learned a talent, they will always have access to any abilities unlocked by their ranks in that talent. Each talent has three ranks.

Techniques: Skills and spells are techniques.

Teleport: A special form of movement that allows for instant movement between two spaces. Teleportation doesn't require line of sight, doesn't provoke reactions , and ignores ENGAGEMENT .  T eleportation always counts as moving 1 space. If a character teleports into a space they can't occupy, the teleport fails and the action is lost.

Terrain: A specific subset of object that includes the environmental elements in a combat scene - trees, walls, rocks, and similar.

Terrain Features: Terrain features modify spaces and terrain on the battlefield. While they generally affect single spaces, multiple terrain features can be placed next to each other to create a continuous feature.

Trait: Abilities that reinforce a beacon's identity and playstyle. Traits come from a beacon's ancestry and equipped job.

Turns: Each character takes one turn per round, taken during one of that round's phases. The action they want to take on their turn determines which phase they act in. On their turn, a character can perform their standard movement , one standard action , one minor action , and any number of free actions (within reason). Most NPCs only take one turn per round, but some NPCs might take multiple turns.

Wound/Overstress: Characters can receive Wounds or become Overstressed . As they accumulate Wounds and Overstresses, their combat performance weakens until they are no longer able to fight.

Zone: A lingering effect from an AOE, which remains in play for a set time or until the end of the scene.

## TAGS

Accurate: Attacks with this tag gain +1 .

Aetheric: Attacks with this tag are made against A-Def instead of Dodge.

Arcing: Abilities with this tag can be aimed over obstacles. They ignore line of sight as long as there is a vertical path to the target, although cover still applies.

Armor: Abilities with this tag represent suits of armor or similar defenses, many of which provide a bonus to ARMOR . A character can only have one ability with this tag equipped at a time.

Aura X: When activated, abilities with this tag affect indicated characters within X spaces of the user. A character can only have one Aura activated at a time and can change Auras 1/turn.

Auto-Hit: Attacks with this tag automatically hit without making an attack roll.

Blast X: Abilities with this tag have an AOE. It affects all targets within a radius of X spaces from the center space, including the center space . Cover and line of sight are calculated from the center space. Users can be affected by their own Blast.

Burst X: Affects all targets within a radius of X spaces from the edge of the spaces occupied by the target, including the target's spaces but excluding the target itself . Cover and line of sight are calculated from the edge of the spaces occupied by the target. If a Burst forms a zone , the zone moves with the target.

Close Blast X: Abilities with this tag have an AOE. It operates like a Blast , but:

-  at least 1 space must be adjacent to the user
-  the user can't be in the area
-  cover and line of sight are calculated from the user.

Consumable X: Abilities with this tag can only be used X times per quest. Consumable abilities represent potions, elixirs, and other items that can be replenished.

Enchantment: Abilities with this tag modify other abilities. Enchantments can typically only be applied to specific types of abilities and can only be applied to one ability at a time. Additionally, each ability can only have one Enchantment at a time. Enchantments can only be applied to a new ability while preparing for a quest or during a Long Rest.

If an Enchantment is destroyed, the ability it is enchanting is not destroyed and vice versa. Traits and talents can't be enchanted.

Focus X: Abilities with this tag cost X FOCUS to use.

Homing: Abilities with this tag ignore line of sight and the effects of cover. As long as the target is within Range and it is possible to reach them (i.e., they aren't in a box), they can be targeted.

Inaccurate: Attacks with this tag receive +1 .

Indirect: Attacks with this tag ignore any from cover.

Innate: Abilities with this tag can't be destroyed or enchanted. They can't be chosen for destruction as the result of a wound roll.

Limited X: Abilities with this tag can only be used X times per quest. Limited abilities provide powerful effects that can't be replenished during a quest once used.

Line X: Abilities with this tag have an AOE. It affects all targets in a straight line with a length of X spaces and a width of 1 space, drawn directly away from you in any direction.

Mana X: Abilities with this tag cost X MP to use.

Polymorph: Abilities with this tag modify the target's form. A character can only be under the effect of one ability with this tag at a time, and any subsequent polymorph effects are automatically cancelled while they are under the effects of a polymorph.

Piercing: Damage with this tag ignores ARMOR .

Pull X: Abilities with this tag inflict a type of forced movement. On a hit, the target is moved X spaces directly toward the origin.

Push X: Abilities with this tag inflict a type of forced movement. On a hit, the target is moved X spaces directly away from the origin.

Range X: Abilities with this tag can be used on targets within X spaces.

Reach X: Abilities with this tag can be used on targets within X spaces. This tag also determines the range of the OPPORTUNITY ATTACK reaction.

Recharge X: Whenever an NPC uses a Recharge ability, it can't be used again until that ability recharges. At the start of each of the NPC's turns after using a Recharge ability, the NPC rolls a d6 recharge die . If the result equals or exceeds the Recharge value (X) of any Recharge abilities they have, those abilities recharge. NPCs only make one recharge roll each turn, but that roll can recharge multiple abilities at once.

Reliable X: Abilities with this tag always deal at least X damage , even if they would miss or deal less than X damage . Reliable damage inherits the ability's damage type and tags; however, Reliable damage does not count as a hit and doesn't trigger any effects that require a hit.

Reloading: Abilities with this tag must be reloaded after each use before they can be used again. This can be done using REFRESH and other abilities.

Slide X: Abilities with this tag inflict a type of forced movement. On a hit, the target is moved X spaces in any direction.

Slow: Abilities with this tag can only be activated as part of FULL ATTACK .

Stressful X: Abilities with this tag inflict X Stress on the user.

Summon: Abilities with this tag create one or more temporary characters under the control of another character, each of which has the Summon tag. Summons have the following statistics unless otherwise indicated:

Basic Summon ( SIZE 1/2 , HP 5 , DODGE/A-DEF 10 , SPEED 0 , SAVE TARGET = Summoner's SAVE TARGET , BULK/AGILITY/MIND/MAGIC 0 )

Summons can only be created in free spaces that they could normally enter (they can't be summoned into impassable terrain, for example).

Summons are characters with a standard action , standard movement , and minor action per round; however, they can't perform any actions unless they have an ability that lets them do so and can't perform a movement unless they have Speed. Their turn is their summoner's turn, and if they can take actions or move, they can do so at any point in their summoner's turn.

Summons are defeated if they are reduced to 0 HP. They can also be dismissed by their summoner as a free action . Summons last until dismissed or defeated, or until the end of the scene.

By default, each character can only have one Summon per ability with this tag in play at a time. If a Summon is defeated or dismissed, a new one can be made using that same ability. Summons can't create Summons.

Thrown X: Abilities with this tag can be used to make a thrown attack , a melee attack made against a target within X spaces. Thrown attacks are affected by cover. If throwing a weapon, it lands in a space adjacent to the target (thrower's choice), and must be picked up as a free action while adjacent to it before it can be used again.

Trap: Abilities with this tag place traps - objects that modify spaces - or are traps themselves. They must be placed in a free adjacent space. They become armed at the end of the turn in which they are placed. Moving into or adjacent to a space occupied by a trap triggers it, activating its effects, after which it is removed from play.

Traps are permanently HIDDEN , but can be automatically detected with SEARCH .  Y ou can attempt to disarm a trap by making an AGILITY check as a minor action when moving into or adjacent to its space (before it is triggered). On a success, the trap is removed from play without being activated. On a failure, it activates as normal.

Unbreakable: Abilities with this tag cannot be destroyed and can't be selected for destruction if there are nonUnbreakable options left. If an Unbreakable result is selected from a wound or overstress roll, it becomes a DAZED result instead.

Unique: Characters can only equip one copy of each ability with this tag at a time.

## COMBAT QUICK GUIDE

Combat takes place within combat scenes . Each combat is made up of a number of rounds . By default, each PC beacon and each NPC takes one turn each round.

<!-- image -->

## COMBAT STRUCTURE

Each round is broken up into eight phases . Characters take their turns in one of these phases. The phase determines which standard actions can be performed.

| PHASE      | STANDARD ACTIONS   | STANDARD ACTIONS   | STANDARD ACTIONS   |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| BOLSTER    | Defend             | Defend             | Refresh            |
| CHANNEL    | Channel            | Channel            | Channel            |
| SKIRMISH   | Mark               | Search             | Volley             |
| REPOSITION | Rush               | Rush               | Hide               |
| BRAWL      | Fight              | Shove              | Grapple            |
| RELEASE    | Release            | Release            | Release            |
| FULLATTACK | Full Attack        | Full Attack        | Full Attack        |
| DELAY      | Delay              | Delay              | Delay              |
| ANYPHASE   | Ready              | Ready              | Ready              |

## Player Turns

You take your turn each round during one of the eight phases. During your turn, you can do the following in any order:

<!-- image -->

You can only take standard actions available in the current phase.

## Order

Each round starts with PHASE BOLSTER , and ends with PHASE DELAY .

PCs and NPCs alternate turns. If a PC decides to take their turn during PHASE , then an NPC has the chance to take the next turn in that phase. If no one else takes a turn that phase, the next phase begins. The pattern of alternating turns continues across phases and rounds. This means that if the final turn in a round is taken by a PC, an NPC will have the first opportunity to act in the next round.

At the end of PHASE , a new round begins, starting at PHASE .

## REROLL TABLE

PCs can choose to reroll attacks, checks, and saves during combat, choosing from a list of penalties. This is called using the Reroll Table .

Each option on the Reroll Table can only be used 1/round.

## REROLL TABLE

| STRAIN     | You take 1d3 Stress .                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ENDANGER   | You become MARKED . You can't use this option if you are MARKED . This doesn't count as a condition that you've given yourself.                                              |
| OVEREXTEND | Youcanonly choose this option if you are adjacent to an enemy or within REACH of an enemy's weapon. The enemycanchooseoneofthefollow- ing, which resolves before you reroll: |

- Ø They  make  an OPPORTUNITY ATTACK against you.
- Ø They deal 3 PHYSICAL to you as a reaction .

## SURGE

Each PC can SURGE once per round, allowing them to take a second turn. This costs a certain amount of Stress based on their SURGE level, which increases each time they SURGE and resets when they next take a Long Rest. This second turn counts as a brand-new turn, giving them a new standard action, standard movement, and minor action.

The Stress cost for surging is listed below. This Stress is taken at the start of a SURGE turn, before anything else. The cost does not progress past 1d6+4.

## STANDARD ACTIONS

Phase 1: Bolster

## Defend

PHASE BOLSTER

You gain FOCUS equal to your ARMOR+1D3 . Until the start of your next turn, attacks against you are made with +1 .

## Refresh

## PHASE BOLSTER

Choose one of the following:

- Ø Spend a RECOVERY to regain all HP .
- Ø Clear all Stress .
- Ø Regain all MP .

Then choose one of the following:

- Ø Reload all Reloading weapons/abilities.
- Ø Clear all Discord .
- Ø Clear a condition that wasn't caused by yourself.
- Ø Clear a condition on an adjacent ally that wasn't caused by them.

Phase 2: Channel

|   SURGE LEVEL | STRESS COST    |
|---------------|----------------|
|             0 | 2 Stress .     |
|             1 | 1d3+1 Stress . |
|             2 | 1d6+2 Stress . |
|             3 | 1d6+4 Stress . |

## Channel

## PHASE CHANNEL

You begin to enact a CHANNEL ability, the effect of which you can unleash in PHASE with the RELEASE action. This is the only way to trigger a channeled ability's RELEASE effect. Until you release it, you are considered to be channeling.

While channeling, if you take any damage (after ARMOR ) or Stress not caused by yourself, you must pass a BULK save against the other character's SAVE TARGET . This is called a concentration save . On a failure, you lose concentration : you stop channeling and the ability fizzles.

You can only channel one ability at a time, and you can't READY the CHANNEL action. You can stop channeling as a free action . If you don't make a standard movement this turn, you can do so when you RELEASE the ability this round.

CHANNEL abilities are considered to be used at the time this action is taken, and any costs (e.g., MP ) must be paid at that time. Their effects, including choosing targets, only happen when they're released unless the ability specifically states they happen when channeling.
